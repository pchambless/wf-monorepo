## üìä Architecture Insights

### Key Architectural Patterns Established:
1. **EventTypes as Single Source of Truth** - All navigation, widgets, and UI configuration flows from eventTypes definitions
2. **ContextStore Architecture** - Centralized session state management with automatic parameter resolution
3. **Configuration-Driven UI** - PageMaps ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Rendered UI pipeline
4. **Separation of Concerns** - Navigation relationships vs widget relationships clearly separated
5. **Directive-Based Generation** - Manual customizations preserved during automated generation

### Development Philosophy:
- **MVP Break-and-Fix Approach** - No backward compatibility, fix issues as they arise
- **Infrastructure-Generated Documentation** - Documentation emerges from actual code and configuration
- **Incremental Problem Solving** - Each plan addresses specific issues while building toward cohesive architecture
