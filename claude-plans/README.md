# ðŸ§  Claude Plans Workspace

This folder serves as a scoped planning and collaboration space between Paul and Claude. It supports an investigation-first development workflow centered around focused prompts, AI-assisted analysis, and iterative refinement.

## Folder Structure

- `a-pending/` â€“ Active development ideas and scoped investigations awaiting validation or implementation  
- `b-completed/` â€“ Finalized plans including Claudeâ€™s strategic insights, completed action steps, and handoffs to subsequent phases  
- `index.md` â€“ Directory-level overview or guide to completed plans 
- `nameing convention` - new plans should use this naming convention `yyyy-mm-dd descriptive-name.md`.

## Workflow Philosophy

Each entry in this workspace starts with a clearly defined idea or need. Claude assists by analyzing the request, proposing a task breakdown, and suggesting implementation or cleanup strategies. Plans evolve across phases, often referencing earlier tasks for context.

This folder reflects an exploratory development styleâ€”keeping efforts focused, traceable, and scoped for maximum clarity.

## Future Considerations

If additional collaborators join or the workflow expands, this folder could evolve into a more general `dev-cycles/` or `sprint-plans/` structure. For now, it documents the evolving dialogue between architecture and action.
