# Navigation Fix - Status Update

## Problem Fixed
- ✅ Navigation from sidebar to ingredient pages now works
- ✅ Fixed infinite loop in account state management  
- ✅ Account selector (SelUserAcct) maintains data across pages
- ✅ Routes are generated correctly from eventTypes.js

## Changes Made
1. **accountService.js**: Modified switchAccount to not auto-redirect to dashboard
2. **App.jsx**: 
   - Moved account state management to App level (was Dashboard-scoped)
   - Fixed infinite re-render with React.useMemo and useCallback
   - Cleaned up debug routes that were interfering
   - Fixed lazy component import logic

## Current Status
- Navigation works: sidebar → `/ingredients/1/ingrTypeList` 
- Account data persists across all pages
- No more redirect loops

## Testing Needed
1. Test clicking "Ingredients" in sidebar
2. Verify SelUserAcct widget shows account list on all pages
3. Test other navigation items (Products, References, etc.)

## Architecture Notes
- Single source of truth: `eventTypes.js` → `routes.js` → `App.jsx`
- Account state: App-level, shared across all routes
- Route generation: Works from entityRegistry (built from eventTypes)

## Files Modified
- `/apps/wf-client/src/services/accountService.js`
- `/apps/wf-client/src/App.jsx`

Ready for testing and cleanup!
