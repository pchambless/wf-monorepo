## User Idea

Phase 1 -  Create this new Plan 0020 DEVTOOLS Architecture Test using the Tool
- Validate the structure of the Plan created with the sections and the User Idea section populated with this text.
- Validate that a DB plans table is added.
- Validate that a DB plan_documents row is added. 
- Validate that a DB plan_impacts row is added.

Phase 2 - Discussion User and Claude
- Discuss what the folder/file structure for each plan should look like
- Settle on file naming standards for the identified necessary documents.  
	- if a document is in a plan folder, do we need the plan number in the name?

Phase 3 - Communication
- Design how and what communication should take place upon creation of a Plan.
- Discuss when should a communication event be recorded in the DB plan_communications table.  
 -- Questions:  	How automated can this be?  
					Can Claude create communication events?
					Should there be a callable module that can be invoked to replace the current communication file creation like the plan-impact module?
					Should a user Communication tab be built that invokes the callable module?
- After plan creation, Claude should be notified and proceed with Analysis.  This may be the User notifying Claude.

Phase 4: Document creation
- Claude user discussion:  What documents should be created and by which agent?
1.  Plan - User
2.  Analysis - Claude
3.  Requirements-Guidance - Claude (Is this one document or 2 documents?
4.  Issues - Could this just be a communication event stored in DB plan-communications or should it be a document?
5.  Specs -  Kiro
		- Design - Kiro
		- Requirements -  Is this Kiro?
		- Tasks - Kiro
