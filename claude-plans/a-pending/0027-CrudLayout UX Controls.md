## User idea

  Currently, pageMap files control both data structure AND UX layout (column widths, form groupings, etc.), but they're auto-generated by genPageMaps.js. This creates a fundamental
  conflict:

  - Regeneration Problem: Manual UX tweaks to pageMaps get wiped out when we regenerate from SQL changes
  - Layout Breaking: Fixed column widths now cause tables to exceed container width, pushing forms below tables instead of maintaining the intended 7/5 grid layout
  - Developer Friction: We need to manually adjust column widths for UX, but can't safely do so without breaking the generation workflow

  We need a solution that allows:
  1. Safe UX control - developers can tune layout without fear of regeneration
  2. Responsive layout - CrudLayout maintains grid constraints regardless of content width
  3. Clear separation - data structure generation vs UX presentation concerns

  This affects every CRUD page and the core development workflow, making it a critical UX architecture decision.
