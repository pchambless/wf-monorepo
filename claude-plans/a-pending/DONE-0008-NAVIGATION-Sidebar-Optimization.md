# NAVIGATION - Sidebar Optimization

## User Idea
I'd like to reorganize the appbar and sidebar.  Currently we have a bit of a space issue, or it will be.  We have a lot of empty real estate in the appbar at the top of all pages, and it needs some formatting.  We also have redundant "Whatsfresh Client" display in both the appbar and sidebar.  Here's how I'd like to reconfigure.

Appbar:  Hamburger menu -> Logo -> "Whatsfresh" -> pageTitle -> SelUserAcct -> Logout.

Sidebar: Navigation sections Business Setup, Reference Data, Batch Management.

Also, make the background color for the appbar match that of the sidebar.
