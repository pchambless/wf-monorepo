# Recipe Page

## User Idea
The recipe page is not a standard CRUD page - it's a specialized workflow that needs its own views and components. Like the btchMapping page, it has unique interaction patterns that don't fit the standard list/form model.

**Key Insight:** Recipe management involves complex ingredient relationships, measurements, ordering, and potentially multi-step processes that require specialized views rather than generic CRUD operations.

**Appsmith Prototypes Available:** Paul has working SQL and UI patterns from Appsmith that can be adapted for WhatsFresh 2.0.

## Specialized Nature
- Not a simple list/add/edit/delete workflow
- Involves ingredient selection, quantities, measurements, ordering
- May have drag-and-drop or other interactive elements
- Requires views that understand recipe structure and relationships

## Implementation Impact Analysis

### Impact Summary
- **Files**: 15 (see impact-tracking.json: plan_id="2025-07-15-recipe-page")
- **Complexity**: High (specialized workflow, complex ingredient relationships)
- **Packages**: apps/wf-client (5), sql/views (4), packages/devtools (4), claude-plans (2)
- **Blast Radius**: RECIPES (low), DEVTOOLS (medium)

### Impact Tracking Status
- **Predicted**: 15 files
- **Actual**: 15 files (+0 discovered)
- **Accuracy**: 100%
- **JSON Reference**: All detailed tracking in `/claude-plans/impact-tracking.json`

### Plan Dependencies
- **Blocks**: None identified
- **Blocked by**: None (can proceed independently)
- **Related**: 2025-07-15 Batch Mapping (similar specialized page pattern)
- **File Conflicts**: None identified

### Package Impact Summary
- **üîß DevTools** (packages/devtools/): Medium impact - 3 files
- **üì± WF-Client** (apps/wf-client/): High impact - 5 files
- **üóÑÔ∏è SQL Views** (sql/views/client/): High impact - 4 files
- **üìù Plans** (claude-plans/): Low impact - 2 files

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Analyze Appsmith patterns and create architecture design
2. **Phase 2**: Create SQL views for recipe workflow
3. **Phase 3**: Design and implement component architecture
4. **Phase 4**: Configure eventTypes for recipe-specific interactions
5. **Phase 5**: Test and iterate on workflow usability

**Note:** This is a separate specialized page alongside btchMapping - both deviate from standard CRUD patterns and need their own architectural approach.
