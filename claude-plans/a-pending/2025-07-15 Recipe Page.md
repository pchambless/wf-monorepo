# Recipe Page

## User Idea
The recipe page is not a standard CRUD page - it's a specialized workflow that needs its own views and components. Like the btchMapping page, it has unique interaction patterns that don't fit the standard list/form model.

**Key Insight:** Recipe management involves complex ingredient relationships, measurements, ordering, and potentially multi-step processes that require specialized views rather than generic CRUD operations.

**Appsmith Prototypes Available:** Paul has working SQL and UI patterns from Appsmith that can be adapted for WhatsFresh 2.0.

## Specialized Nature
- Not a simple list/add/edit/delete workflow
- Involves ingredient selection, quantities, measurements, ordering
- May have drag-and-drop or other interactive elements
- Requires views that understand recipe structure and relationships

## Next Steps
1. Analyze Appsmith SQL and UI patterns for recipe management
3. Create the necessary SQL views for recipe workflow
4. Design the component architecture for recipe page
5. Configure eventTypes for recipe-specific interactions

**Note:** This is a separate specialized page alongside btchMapping - both deviate from standard CRUD patterns and need their own architectural approach.
