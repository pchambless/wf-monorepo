# Session Persistence Fix - User/Account State

**Date**: 2025-07-09  
**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Priority**: HIGH

## Problem Description

When the browser page is refreshed, the application loses critical session state:
- `userID` is lost → `userAcctList` event fails (needs `userID` parameter)
- `acctID` is lost → account selection is reset
- `SelUserAcct` component displays "No accounts available"

This breaks the user experience and requires re-authentication/account selection after every refresh.

## Root Cause Analysis

The current authentication flow works initially:
1. User logs in → `userID` is set in memory
2. `userAcctList` event fetches accounts for that `userID`
3. User selects account → `acctID` is set in memory
4. Pages work correctly with both `userID` and `acctID`

**On page refresh**: Both `userID` and `acctID` are lost from memory, breaking the entire flow.

## Proposed Solution

### Phase 1: Identify Current State Management
- [ ] Investigate existing auth/state management in shared-imports
- [ ] Check if there's a user/auth context component
- [ ] Review navigation component's account selection logic
- [ ] Identify where `userID` and `acctID` are currently stored

### Phase 2: Implement Session Persistence
**Options to evaluate:**
1. **localStorage/sessionStorage** - Store `userID` and `acctID` in browser storage
2. **JWT tokens** - Include user info in authentication token
3. **URL parameters** - Include user/account info in routes
4. **Session cookies** - Server-side session management

✨ Phase 2: Practical Decision Criteria for Persistence Options
| Option                    | Secure  | Auto-Restores    | Scales | Setup Required | 
| localStorage              | ❌     | ✅               | ✅    | ❌ | 
| JWT Tokens + localStorage | ✅     | ✅               | ✅    | ❌ | 
| Session Cookies           | ✅    | ✅                | ✅    | ✅ (needs session store) | 
| URL Parameters            | ❌    | 🚫                | ✅    | ❌ | 

### Phase 3: Restore State on App Load
- [ ] Implement state restoration logic in app initialization
- [ ] Ensure `userAcctList` event is called with restored `userID`
- [ ] Restore selected `acctID` and update `SelUserAcct` component
- [ ] Test refresh behavior across different pages

Possible encapsulation
const restoreSession = () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem('wfSessionToken');
  if (!token) return;

  const { userID, acctID } = decodeJWT(token); // Or JSON.parse if using raw values

  setUserID(userID);         // hydrate MobX or Context
  setAcctID(acctID);         // update selection logic
  fetchUserAccounts(userID); // re-trigger `userAcctList` event
};


## Technical Details

### Key Components Involved
- `SelUserAcct` component (shows "No accounts available")
- `userAcctList` event (requires `userID` parameter)
- `other parameters` will need to be evaluated (`prodTypeList`, `prodBtchlist`, etc)
- Navigation component (handles account selection)
- Authentication flow (sets initial `userID`)

### Event Dependencies
```
userLogin → userID → userAcctList → acctID → page functionality
```

## Success Criteria
- [x] Page refresh maintains user session
- [x] `SelUserAcct` shows correct accounts after refresh
- [x] Selected account remains active after refresh
- [x] No re-authentication required on refresh
- [x] Works across all pages in the application

## Notes
- This is a foundational fix that affects all CRUD pages
- May require updates to shared-imports components
- Should be tested thoroughly across different browsers
- Consider security implications of chosen persistence method

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ **Completed Solution**: Enhanced localStorage Persistence

#### Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced userStore.js** (`/packages/shared-imports/src/stores/userStore.js`):
   - Changed `STORAGE_KEY` from `'whatsfresh_user_preference'` to `'whatsfresh_user_session'`
   - Added `loadPersistedSession()` method that restores full authentication state
   - Added `persistSession()` method that saves `currentUser`, `isAuthenticated`, and `defaultAcctID`
   - Updated `setUserData()`, `setDefaultAccount()`, and `logout()` to use session persistence
   - Added `clearSession()` method for complete logout

2. **Enhanced App.jsx** (`/apps/wf-client/src/App.jsx`):
   - Added `useUserStore()` hook and session restoration logic
   - Added authentication-based route protection for all routes
   - Added loading state while session is being restored
   - Redirects authenticated users from `/login` to `/dashboard` automatically

3. **Enhanced Dashboard Presenter** (`/apps/wf-client/src/pages/dashboard/Presenter.js`):
   - Updated account selection logic to prefer persisted `defaultAcctID` over user default
   - Added automatic session persistence when user changes accounts
   - Improved logging for account selection flow

#### Key Benefits:
- **Automatic Session Restoration**: User stays logged in across browser refreshes
- **Account Persistence**: Selected account is remembered and restored
- **Seamless User Experience**: No re-authentication required on refresh
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing login flow
- **Security**: No sensitive data stored, only user profile and account preference

#### Testing:
- ✅ Login → refresh → still authenticated
- ✅ Select account → refresh → same account selected
- ✅ Navigate to pages → refresh → pages still accessible
- ✅ Logout → refresh → redirected to login
- ✅ Login flow works properly (navigates to dashboard)
- ✅ Logout button clears all session data and redirects to login
- ✅ Session persistence works across all page refreshes

## 🎉 **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE & TESTED**

This implementation has been successfully tested and is working as intended. The session persistence system provides:

- **Seamless user experience** - No re-authentication needed on page refresh
- **Automatic parameter resolution** - `execEvent('listName')` works without manual params
- **Hierarchical context preservation** - Selection state persists across sessions
- **Clean logout flow** - Complete session cleanup with proper navigation

The system now matches the elegance of the original implementation while providing enhanced functionality through the unified contextStore architecture.
