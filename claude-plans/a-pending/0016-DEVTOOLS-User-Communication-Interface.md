# DEVTOOLS - User Communication Interface

## User Idea
The User should have a way to get in on the communication loop... Since the new dashboard kiro created is in place, I'm wondering if kiro could create
an interface form so I can put in my 2 cents in strategic places... 
User: communicated identifier, like you and kiro have an identifier... I guess this is a new plan...

I'm also wondering if we can build the use of the plan-tools into a tab in this page.

Create tabs:
    - Plan Communication
    - Plan Tools
    - Structure Relationships (better name welcomed.  The Madge stuff.)

Long term thought: if this whole interface, including the madge analysis, is captured in a single page, it could be migrated to the Admin app when we get into building that app out.

## Implementation Impact Analysis

### Impact Summary
- **Plan ID**: 0015
- **Files**: TBD (see impact-tracking.json: plan_id="0015")
- **Complexity**: TBD (High|Medium|Low)
- **Packages**: TBD (package names and file counts)
- **Blast Radius**: DEVTOOLS (medium)

### Impact Tracking Status
- **Predicted**: TBD files
- **Actual**: TBD files (+X discovered)
- **Accuracy**: TBD%
- **JSON Reference**: All detailed tracking in `/claude-plans/impact-tracking.json`

### Plan Dependencies
- **Blocks**: [List plans that can't proceed until this is done]
- **Blocked by**: [List plans that must complete first]
- **Related**: [List plans with overlapping scope]
- **File Conflicts**: [Specific files being modified by multiple plans]
