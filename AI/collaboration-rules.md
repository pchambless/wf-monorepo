# AI Collaboration Framework
**Claude Code ‚Üî Kiro ‚Üî User Coordination Rules**

---

## üìã Plan Management Rules

### Plan Creation Authority
- **Primary**: Claude Code creates plans after investigation and analysis
- **Exception**: Kiro may create plans during active architectural discussions
- **Validation**: Claude must review and approve any Kiro-created plans
- **Override**: User has final veto/approval authority on all plans

### Plan Numbering & Tracking
- **Sequential IDs**: Auto-increment (0001, 0002, etc.)
- **No Conflicts**: Each plan gets unique ID regardless of creator
- **Impact Tracking**: Kiro maintains auto-generated impact registry
- **Status Updates**: Real-time progress tracking in structured files

### Plan Lifecycle
```

### üë®‚Äçüíº User Domain
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Business requirements & feature priorities
- Strategic direction & scope decisions
- Final approval authority on all plans
- Conflict resolution between AI agents
- Quality acceptance & production readiness
- Workflow coordination & swim lane enforcement

**Authority:**
- Override any AI decision or recommendation

## ü§ù Communication Protocols

### File Structure
```
/AI/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ collaboration-rules.md (this document)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coordination-log.json (active coordination status)

.kiro/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ communication/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ claude-requests/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kiro-questions/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ coordination-log.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ specs/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ impact-registry.json
```

### Handoff Triggers
**Explicit Communication Format:**
- `Claude Code: [Request Type]` - Kiro requests Claude input
- `Kiro: [Request Type]` - Claude requests Kiro action
- `User: [Decision/Direction]` - User provides guidance

**Emergency Communication Triggers:**
- `ARCHITECTURAL_QUESTION` - Kiro needs Claude input to proceed
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE` - Kiro finished, ready for Claude review
- `BLOCKING_ISSUE` - Either AI needs User intervention

**Phase Gate Reviews:**
1. **Architecture Review** - Claude validates approach
2. **Pattern Review** - Collaborative pattern validation  
3. **Implementation Review** - Claude reviews generated code
4. **Integration Review** - Full system integration testing
5. **Performance Review** - Production readiness validation

### Status Communication
- **Progress Updates**: Kiro updates coordination-log.json
- **Blocking Issues**: Immediate escalation to User
- **Architectural Questions**: Formal communication files
- **Implementation Complete**: Auto-notification via impact registry

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflict Resolution

### Claude ‚Üî Kiro Conflicts
1. **Technical Disagreement**: User makes final decision
2. **Scope Creep**: Claude can block over-engineering
3. **Implementation Approach**: Collaborative discussion required
4. **Timeline Issues**: User sets priorities and deadlines

### Escalation Procedures
- **Immediate**: For security or architectural risks
- **Same Session**: For implementation questions
- **Next Session**: For strategic or business decisions
- **Formal Review**: For major architectural changes

---

## üö® Emergency Overrides

### User Emergency Powers
- **HALT**: Stop all AI work immediately
- **REDIRECT**: Change direction mid-implementation  
- **OVERRIDE**: Ignore AI recommendations
- **RESET**: Return to previous stable state

### Claude Emergency Powers
- **BLOCK IMPLEMENTATION**: Prevent architectural risks
- **REQUEST INVESTIGATION**: Require additional analysis
- **ESCALATE TO USER**: Force user decision on critical issues

### Kiro Emergency Powers  
- **REQUEST CLARIFICATION**: Block unclear specifications
- **REPORT CONFLICTS**: Identify contradictory requirements
- **SUGGEST ALTERNATIVES**: Propose implementation options

## üîÑ Established Workflows

### Investigation ‚Üí Implementation
1. User describes business need
2. Claude investigates existing patterns
3. Claude creates plan with architectural analysis
4. User approves plan and approach
5. Kiro implements following specifications
6. Claude reviews implementation
