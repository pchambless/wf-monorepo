# n8n Workflow Registry

This folder contains a dynamically generated `workflows.json` file listing all available n8n workflow webhooks for agent use.

## How it works
- The registry is generated by running the script:
  
  ```bash
  node ../.n8n/scripts/generate-workflow-registry.js
  ```
- It scans all `.json` workflow files in `.n8n/workflows/` and outputs a mapping of workflow names to webhook URLs and descriptions.
- Agents should always consult this file to discover available workflows and their endpoints.

## Adding a new workflow
1. Add your workflow JSON to `.n8n/workflows/`.
2. Run the script above to regenerate the registry.
3. The new workflow will appear in `workflows.json`.

## Example `workflows.json`
```json
{
  "session-startup": {
    "url": "http://localhost:5678/webhook/session-startup",
    "description": "Aggregated session context for all agents"
  },
  "adhoc-query": {
    "url": "http://localhost:5678/webhook/adhoc-query",
    "description": "Run arbitrary SQL queries"
  }
}
```

## Best Practices
- Never hardcode workflow URLs in agent code—always use this registry.
- Keep workflow names and descriptions clear and unique.
- Regenerate the registry after adding, removing, or renaming workflows.
