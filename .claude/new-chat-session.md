Session Startup Summary - TextArea Widget Fix Complete

  Key Accomplishments

  ✅ Fixed TextArea widget - Replaced complex Material-UI TextField with simple HTML textarea
  ✅ Plan 36 created - "Reorganize ArchIntel Page" with detailed requirements
  ✅ EventType hierarchy defined - archIntel → SelPlanStatus → [planList, tabs] flow documented
  ✅ Analysis pipeline working - All npm run analyze:* scripts converted to ES modules

  Current Status

  - TextArea widget: Now uses plain HTML - stores plain text, no overflow issues
  - Width issue remains: Both plan name field and textarea need to be wider
  - Plan 36 ready: Kiro can start ArchIntel redesign using eventTypes.mmd as blueprint
  - Theme RTL disabled: Removed direction: "rtl" that was causing layout conflicts

  Next Session Tasks

  1. Fix field widths - Make plan name and textarea fields wider in forms
  2. Coordinate Plan 36 - Ensure Kiro follows eventType hierarchy for ArchIntel redesign
  3. Test TextArea - Verify long text pasting works correctly in production

  Key Files Modified

  - /packages/shared-imports/src/components/forms/TextArea.jsx - Plain HTML implementation
  - /apps/wf-client/src/theme.js - Disabled RTL direction
  - /analysis-n-document/output/eventTypes.mmd - Contains ArchIntel flow blueprint

  Architecture Notes

  - EventTypes drive routes - Paul owns eventType definitions, implementation follows
  - Plain textarea proven - Sometimes simple HTML beats complex React components
  - Material-UI version conflict - Root cause of many styling issues (v5 vs v7)

  Ready to continue with Plan 36 implementation and field width adjustments.
