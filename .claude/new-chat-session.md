 # Session Restart Context - Plan 0040 Progress

  ## Where We Left Off

  We were working on Plan 0040 "Plan Management MVP Completion" and made significant progress on:

  1. **Generator Path Cleanup** ✅
     - Fixed all genDocs generators to use `analysis-n-document/output/json/` and `output/reports/`
     - Eliminated duplicate generation to `apps/wf-client/public/analysis-data/`
     - Updated package.json scripts to use new genDocs/ structure
     - Fixed ES module issues and path resolution problems

  2. **EventTypes Modularization** ✅
     - Successfully modularized client and admin eventTypes into individual files
     - Created proper index.js files with EVENTS arrays
     - Updated main events/index.js to import from new structure
     - Server confirmed working with updated import structure

  3. **Design Document Enhancement** ✅
     - Added genDirectives and genWorkflows automation to `.kiro/0040/design.md`
     - Established hybrid approach with dual-zone pattern (auto-generated + manual zones)
     - Decided on co-located workflow.js and display.js files (following existing .display.js patterns)
     - Added template system, update strategy, and validation approaches

  ## Current State

  **Clean Output Structure:**
  analysis-n-document/output/
  ├── json/ (all .json files)
  └── reports/ (only .mmd files - no .md files)

  **Next Phase Strategy:**
  - Kiro handles complex architectural tasks (template processing, safe regeneration logic)
  - Lighter models handle straightforward implementation (SQL parsing, file creation, validation)
  - Focus on genDirectives and genWorkflows automation for plan-management MVP

  ## Key Files to Reference
  - `.kiro/0040/design.md` - Complete design with dual-zone pattern
  - `.kiro/0040/tasks.md` - Detailed task breakdown (6.1-6.3 marked complete by Kiro)
  - `analysis-n-document/genDocs/` - Updated generators using clean output structure
  - `packages/shared-imports/src/events/` - Modularized eventTypes structure

  ## Immediate Next Steps
  Ready to continue with genDirectives/genWorkflows automation or any other Plan 0040 MVP tasks.
