 WF-Studio MCP Integration & Modular Refactoring - Session Summary

  ✅ Accomplishments Completed

  🏗️ Major Architectural Refactoring

  - Broke down 518-line monster StudioPageRenderer.tsx into 6 focused, maintainable modules:
    - useStudioState.ts (173 lines) - Custom hook for all state management
    - StudioLayout.tsx (40 lines) - Main 3-column layout structure
    - StudioSidebar.tsx (67 lines) - Left navigation (app/page selection + eventType accordion)
    - StudioTabs.tsx (57 lines) - Right tabbed work area (Component Detail, Mermaid, Page Renderer)
    - StudioComponentChoices.tsx (40 lines) - Middle component palette
    - StudioPageRenderer.tsx (18 lines) - Clean orchestrator that ties everything together

  🎯 Component Detail Tab Enhancement

  - Implemented card-based Component Detail interface (ComponentDetailCards.tsx)
  - Organized eventType properties into visual cards:
    - 🔵 Basic Properties (category, title, cluster, eventType, purpose)
    - 🟢 Data Binding (qry, displayConfig)
    - 🟣 Workflow Triggers (organized by trigger type with actions)
    - 🔴 Validation Rules (field validation constraints)
    - 🟠 Components Layout (visual breakdown of component positioning)
    - 🟦 Special Properties (routePath, workflows)
    - 🔘 Raw JSON (collapsible for debugging)
  - All cards are editable with inline form controls

  📊 Documentation Created

  - Mermaid flow diagram at /home/paul/wf-studio/docs/flows/componentDetailCards.mmd visualizing the card-based rendering architecture

  🔧 MCP-Only Integration

  - Eliminated HTTP fallbacks - Studio now uses MCP filesystem exclusively
  - Updated Studio state management to use MCP API only (no localhost:2002 calls)
  - Updated pageConfigListAPI to use MCP filesystem instead of HTTP fetch
  - Updated pageEventTypeDtl to use MCP for file reading
  - Added TypeScript declarations for Tauri context (window.__TAURI__)

  ✅ Build System Fixes

  - Fixed original syntax error from 518-line monster file
  - Resolved TypeScript errors for all new modular Studio components
  - Clean separation of concerns achieved

  🚧 Work Remaining

  🔑 Critical - MCP Filesystem Server Setup

  Priority: HIGH - This is the blocker preventing the Studio from working
  - Configure filesystem MCP server in Claude Code
  claude mcp add filesystem -s local node @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /path/to/wf-monorepo-new
  - Test MCP filesystem integration - verify it can read:
    - wf-monorepo-new/apps/ directory listing
    - Individual eventType files (.js files in /pages/ directories)
  - Debug MCP path resolution - ensure paths match between Studio and filesystem server root

  🧹 Legacy Code Cleanup

  Priority: MEDIUM - Technical debt from claudia app days
  - Remove unused legacy components in src/components/legacy/
  - Fix API type mismatches in src/lib/queryAPI.ts (eventID property errors)
  - Remove unused imports throughout codebase
  - Clean up React import statements (many still have unused React imports)

  🎨 Studio Feature Completion

  Priority: MEDIUM - Enhance the Studio experience
  - Implement Mermaid Chart tab - visualize eventType component relationships
  - Implement Page Renderer tab - live preview of eventType layouts
  - Make Component Choices interactive - drag/drop or click to add components
  - Add save functionality - persist eventType edits back to files (requires MCP write capability)
  - Add validation - ensure eventType edits are syntactically correct

  ⚙️ MCP Write Operations

  Priority: LOW - Future enhancement
  - Research MCP filesystem write capabilities - most are read-only by design
  - Consider alternative save mechanism - potentially use Tauri commands for writes
  - Implement eventType file generation from edited components

  🏃‍♂️ Immediate Next Steps

  1. Set up filesystem MCP server - This unblocks everything
  2. Test the Studio interface - Should now show apps/pages from wf-monorepo-new
  3. Verify Component Detail cards work with real eventType data
  4. Clean up build warnings by removing unused imports

  📁 Key Files Modified

  New Modular Architecture:

  - src/components/Studio/hooks/useStudioState.ts
  - src/components/Studio/components/StudioLayout.tsx
  - src/components/Studio/components/StudioSidebar.tsx
  - src/components/Studio/components/StudioTabs.tsx
  - src/components/Studio/components/StudioComponentChoices.tsx
  - src/components/Studio/ComponentDetailCards.tsx

  Updated APIs:

  - src/api/pageConfigList.ts - Now MCP-only
  - src/api/pageEventTypeDtl.ts - Now MCP-only
  - src/lib/mcpAPI.ts - Ready for filesystem operations

  Documentation:

  - /home/paul/wf-studio/docs/flows/componentDetailCards.mmd - Component Detail rendering flow

  The refactoring is complete and the architecture is clean. The main blocker is getting the filesystem MCP server configured and working!
