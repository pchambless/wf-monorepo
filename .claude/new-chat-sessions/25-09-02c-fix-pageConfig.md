 Session Accomplishments & Next Steps

  🎯 What We Accomplished

  API Infrastructure Complete

  - ✅ Fixed Studio Discovery APIs - Server path resolution corrected, APIs now return proper JSON instead of HTML
  - ✅ WorkflowEngine Integration - Added execApps() and execPages() methods using shared-imports pattern
  - ✅ Shared-Imports API Wrappers - Created /packages/shared-imports/src/api/execApps.js and execPages.js with standard {id, label} format
  - ✅ EventType Widgets Created - Built selectApp.js and selectPage.js with proper workflowTriggers for Studio

  Code Cleanup

  - ✅ Removed Legacy Discovery - Eliminated studioAppDiscovery usage from PageRenderer (was causing conflicts)
  - ✅ Cleaned CONFIG Logic - Removed unnecessary CONFIG handling from WorkflowEngine as requested

  Architecture Foundation

  - ✅ Auto-Discovery Framework - Rewrote genPageConfig.js to automatically discover eventTypes from folder structures instead of hardcoded imports
  - ✅ Template-to-EventType Conversion - Converted key Studio widgets to eventType structure

  🚧 Current Blocker

  PageConfig Generation Path Resolution Issue: Auto-discovery finds all 22 eventType files in Studio folder but fails to import them due to path resolution conflicts when running from
   genPageConfig.js working directory.

  🎯 Next Steps (When You Return)

  Immediate Priority: Fix the Bottleneck

  1. Create Studio EventTypes API - /api/studio/eventTypes/{app}/{page} endpoint that server-side scans and returns eventType definitions as JSON
  2. Update genPageConfig.js - Use API call instead of filesystem imports to get eventType data
  3. Generate Studio pageConfig - Run updated genPageConfig to create proper Studio configuration
  4. Test Select Widgets - Verify selectApp and selectPage populate and trigger properly

  Secondary Tasks

  5. Convert Remaining Templates - Transform other template structures to eventTypes
  6. Studio Validation - Ensure end-to-end workflow from app selection → page selection → eventType hierarchy

  🔍 Key Files for Next Session

  - /apps/wf-server/server/controller/studioDiscovery.js - Add eventTypes endpoint here
  - /apps/wf-studio/src/utils/genPageConfig.js - Switch to API-based discovery
  - /apps/wf-studio/src/pages/Studio/pageConfig.json - Target for regeneration
  - Studio select widgets: /apps/wf-studio/src/eventTypes/studio/pages/Studio/widgets/

  💡 Context for Next Session

  You identified the select widget functionality as "the bottleneck" preventing effective Studio usage. All the API infrastructure is in place - we just need to solve the eventType
  discovery issue to generate the proper pageConfig that includes the working select widgets.

  Approach decided: API-based discovery instead of filesystem imports to avoid path resolution headaches.
