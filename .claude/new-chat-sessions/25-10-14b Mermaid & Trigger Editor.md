Virtual PageConfig Builder, Mermaid & Trigger Editor - 2025-10-14

  Focus: Completed pageConfig generator with component rendering, mermaid diagram generation, and schema-based trigger parameter editor

  ---
  âœ… Major Accomplishments

  1. PageConfig Builder Complete

  - Built modular generator (genGrid.js, genForm.js, genButton.js) - creates full HTML component trees from columns
  - Merged columnOverrides into columns, removed defaultValue, extracted tableName from qrySQL
  - Fixed type coercion issues in IndexedDB queries (string/number normalization)
  - Compact JSON formatting (150 char lines) using json-stringify-pretty-compact

  2. Mermaid Diagram Generation

  - Created genMermaid.js - generates component hierarchy with workflow triggers
  - Shows visible columns inline for Grid/Form, skips HTML structure nodes (table/div/input)
  - Escapes special characters (#123; for {, etc.)
  - Studio generates mermaid, server writes pageMermaid.mmd file
  - Added Mermaid Diagram tab to PagePreviewPanel with live rendering

  3. Smart Trigger Editor

  - Built ParamEditor modal - loads schema/example from triggers table, validates JSON
  - TriggerBuilder enhancements: Edit (modal), Delete (filters deleted), Up/Down arrows (reorder)
  - Fixed component name display in modal title (comp_name + title)
  - Standardized setVals format: [{"key": "value"}] (array of single-key objects only)

  4. DirectRenderer Improvements

  - Added position align support (right â†’ marginLeft: auto)
  - TriggerEngine supports both params and content formats (backward compatible)

  ðŸ“Š Statistics

  - Files created: 8 (genMermaid, genGrid, genForm, genButton, formatPageConfig, ParamEditor, others)
  - Files modified: 8 (TriggerBuilder, PagePreviewPanel, genPageConfigController, setVals, TriggerEngine, styleUtils, ComponentPropertiesPanel, genMermaid)

  ðŸš€ Next Steps

  Immediate

  1. Remove param_schema column - Keep only example field (schema drifts, example is what devs use)
  2. Build smart form generators for ParamEditor - Replace JSON textarea with schema-based inputs
  3. Test full sync workflow - Build â†’ Preview â†’ Sync â†’ Verify 3 files written
  4. Fix trigger examples - setVals has syntax error, review all for correctness

  Short Term

  5. Add copy buttons - Copy pageConfig/mermaid to clipboard
  6. Add param validation - Schema-based validation before save
  7. Remove debug logging - Clean up console statements

  Future

  8. Drag-to-reorder triggers - Better UX than arrows
  9. Trigger templates library - Common patterns (execDML INSERT, setVals from selected, etc.)
  10. Diff viewer - Show changes before sync
  11. React Flow option - Interactive diagram alternative

  ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

  One Standard > Multiple Formats - setVals initially accepted object and array formats. Caused confusion. Now enforces ONE format: [{"key": "val"}]. Standards create clarity.

  Diagram Abstraction Levels - First attempt showed ALL nodes (table/tbody/div). Too cluttered. Now skips HTML structure, shows only business logic (Grid/Form with columns inline).
  Diagrams show WHAT, not HOW.

  Schema vs Example - param_schema drifts from code. Example is copy-paste ready. For small teams: executable examples > formal schemas.

  Mermaid Escaping - Use HTML entity codes (#123; for {) not quotes. Mermaid renders correctly.

  Status: Core pageConfig builder complete and working. Mermaid diagrams rendering. Trigger editor functional with room for UX improvements (smart forms, validation). Ready to test
  full sync workflow.
