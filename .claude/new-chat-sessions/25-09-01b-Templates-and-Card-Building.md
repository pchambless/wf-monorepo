Date: September 2, 2025Focus: Building Template System + Card Building Blocks

  ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS

  1. Template Architecture Breakthrough âœ…

  Discovered the Perfect Building Block Pattern:
  - Templates = Lean orchestrators that define which cards to show
  - Cards = Domain specialists that handle complex UI and data management
  - Composition = Mix and match cards for different eventType needs

  Template Structure:
  formTemplate = {
    category: "form",
    detailCards: ["cardBasics", "cardDataBinding", "cardFormOverrides", "cardWorkflowTriggers", "cardWorkflows"],
    expectedStructure: { /* what PageRenderer expects */ },
    validation: { /* basic rules */ }
  }

  2. Complete Card Building Block System âœ…

  Universal Cards (work with all eventTypes):
  - âœ… cardBasics - category, title, cluster, purpose (existing)
  - âœ… cardComponentLayout - components array management (created)

  Leaf-Specific Cards:
  - âœ… cardDataBinding - qry + "Generate Fields" button (existing)
  - âœ… cardFormOverrides - form field customization (created)
  - âœ… cardGridOverrides - grid column customization (created)
  - âœ… cardWorkflowTriggers - event-based triggers (created)
  - âœ… cardWorkflows - standalone workflows (created)

  3. Clean Template System âœ…

  Container Templates:
  - âœ… containerTemplate (tabs.js) - universal for page, tabs, tab, section, column
  - âœ… sidebarTemplate, appbarTemplate, columnTemplate - specialized containers

  Leaf Templates:
  - âœ… formTemplate - clean orchestrator with 5 cards
  - âœ… gridTemplate - clean orchestrator with 5 cards
  - âœ… btnCreateTemplate - button widgets

  4. Live Preview System Components âœ…

  Real-Time Diff Experience:
  - âœ… EventCurrentView - displays current eventType as formatted JavaScript
  - âœ… EventPreviewView - git-style diff showing changes in real-time
  - âœ… PreviewActions - Apply/Cancel with state management

  User Experience:
  - Edit cards â†’ Preview updates immediately â†’ See exact code changes â†’ Apply with confidence

  5. Data Flow Architecture âœ…

  Skeleton â†’ Enhanced EventType Journey:
  - Hand-built eventTypes (basic structure: category, title, cluster, qry)
  - Studio Enhancement (genFields workflow + card customizations)
  - Final Structure (merged fields array with auto-generated + override attributes)

  Key Insight: Override attributes merge INTO the fields array, not separate arrays. PageRenderer sees one clean fields array.

  ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL WINS

  - LEGO-Style Modularity - Templates orchestrate, cards specialize, infinite combinations
  - Enhancement Journey - Clear path from skeleton to full eventTypes
  - Auto-Generated + Override Pattern - Established across forms and grids
  - Live Diff Preview - Real-time feedback like git diff
  - WorkflowEngine Integration - Both event triggers and standalone workflows

  ðŸš€ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

  1. CSS & Styling System

  - Create consistent styling for all cards and display components
  - Implement git-style diff colors (green +, red -, context lines)
  - Design responsive layout for three-column Studio interface

  2. Custom Field Types Implementation

  - Build componentsArray field type for component layout management
  - Build workflowTriggersObject field type for trigger configuration
  - Build fieldOverridesArray and columnOverridesArray field types

  3. Template Integration Testing

  - Connect templates to Studio Component Detail tab rendering
  - Test card orchestration with real eventType data
  - Validate template-driven card showing/hiding logic

  4. Preview Tab Integration

  - Integrate EventCurrentView, EventPreviewView, PreviewActions into Studio
  - Build real-time diff calculation between current and generated eventTypes
  - Connect Apply/Cancel actions to file saving workflows

  5. Field Generation Enhancement

  - Connect cardDataBinding "Generate Fields" button to genFields workflow
  - Implement field merging logic (auto-generated + overrides â†’ single fields array)
  - Test enhancement journey from skeleton to complete eventTypes

  ðŸ’¡ ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION

  The template + card building block system proves the vision works:
  - Universal approach - same cards work across different eventTypes
  - Composition flexibility - mix cards based on needs
  - Clean separation - templates orchestrate, cards execute
  - Extensible design - new eventType? Just define new detailCards array

  Status: Solid foundation complete. Ready to make Studio fully template-driven! ðŸŽ¯
