Studio Widget Architecture Session Accomplishments & Next Steps

  🎯 Major Accomplishments

  ✅ Established Widget Architecture Pattern

  - Created consistent widget structure: Containers reference widgets via eventType property
  - Clean separation of concerns: Components define placement (position, container), eventTypes define functionality (props, workflows)
  - Implemented first working example: btnGenPageConfig widget with proper button template and cards

  ✅ Folder Structure Reorganization

  - Standardized naming: leafs → widgets, leaf → widgets, containers → containers
  - Clear mental model: containers/ (layout), widgets/ (UI components), page/ (top-level)
  - Future-ready for shared layouts: Identified pattern for shared appbar/sidebar across admin/client/studio apps

  ✅ Template & Card System

  - Generic button template: Simple detailCards array structure following established pattern
  - Button card: buttonProps card for configuring label, variant, size, icon, disabled state
  - Reusable across apps: Template system supports any button widget

  ✅ WorkflowEngine Reorganization

  - Atomic triggers: Basic operations (setVal, getVal, clearVals, onLoad, onRefresh)
  - Data triggers: API operations (execApps, execPages, loadCards, getTemplate)
  - Fixed import paths: Updated all references after folder moves

  ✅ Discovery System Fixes

  - Fixed discoverApps: Uncommented variable assignments causing "apps is not defined" error
  - App/Page selectors working: Studio now populates dropdowns correctly

  🔧 Current Status - Working Features

  - ✅ App Selector: Shows available apps (studio, plans, client, admin)
  - ✅ Page Selector: Shows pages for selected app
  - ✅ btnGenPageConfig: Displays as proper button widget
  - ✅ GenPageConfig execution: Successfully generates pageConfig.json and pageMermaid.mmd
  - ✅ Mermaid chart generation: Creates interactive chart with click handlers

  ❌ Known Issues Requiring Attention

  1. WorkflowTriggers Not Executing

  - Symptom: Components have proper structure but workflows aren't firing
  - Likely cause: WorkflowEngine not properly binding/executing trigger actions
  - Impact: Buttons don't respond to clicks, data doesn't load, refreshes don't work

  2. EventType Resolution Failing

  - Symptom: mermaidChart shows "Type:" (empty) despite referencing eventType: "chartMermaid"
  - Root cause: Widget eventTypes not being discovered/loaded properly
  - Impact: Components render structurally but lose their functionality

  3. Component Template Loading

  - Symptom: "Available Components" shows "No data available"
  - Likely cause: Template discovery system not finding widget templates
  - Impact: Design interface doesn't show available components for selection

  🚀 Next Steps Priority List

  🔥 Critical - Fix WorkflowTriggers

  1. Debug WorkflowEngine execution flow
    - Check if this.contextStore is properly bound
    - Verify workflow action routing (setVal, refresh, etc.)
    - Test with simple button click first
  2. Validate eventType loading pipeline
    - Confirm chartMermaid.js is discoverable by genPageConfig
    - Check if eventType references resolve during page load
    - Debug widget instantiation process

  🎯 High Priority - Complete Widget System

  3. Create remaining widget templates
    - Form template (for form widgets)
    - Grid template (for data grids)
    - Chart template (for chartMermaid - category mismatch?)
  4. Fix Component Discovery
    - Debug template discovery system
    - Ensure all widget categories properly discoverable
    - Test component selection workflow

  📋 Medium Priority - Architecture Cleanup

  5. Implement shared layout vision
    - Design shared appbar/sidebar components
    - Create layout eventTypes structure
    - Plan cross-app layout consistency
  6. Complete widget migration
    - Convert remaining hardcoded components to widget pattern
    - Update all eventType references to use new folder structure
    - Create widget documentation/examples

  💡 Key Insights for Next Session

  WorkflowTriggers Investigation Focus

  - The chartMermaid widget has category: "chart" but we created chart.js template - verify template name matching
  - Check if WorkflowEngine properly imports and binds all trigger methods after reorganization
  - Verify contextStore initialization and getVal/setVal operations

  Architecture Validation

  - The widget pattern is architecturally sound: container → widget reference → widget definition
  - Template system is consistent and extensible
  - Discovery system works for simple cases (apps/pages) but fails for complex eventType resolution

  Success Metrics for Next Session

  1. Click btnGenPageConfig → see notification "Page config regenerated!"
  2. View mermaid chart → see interactive chart with proper styling
  3. Click mermaid node → Component Detail tab activates with widget cards
  4. Available Components → shows discoverable widgets/templates

  The widget architecture foundation is solid - now need to connect the workflow execution plumbing!
