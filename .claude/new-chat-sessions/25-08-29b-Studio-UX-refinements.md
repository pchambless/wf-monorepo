 Date: August 29, 2025Focus: Enhanced eventType field generation with grp horizontal grouping system

  ðŸŽ¯ Session Accomplishments

  1. Enhanced EventType Architecture Design âœ…

  Vision Established: Replace separate -display.js files with embedded fields arrays in eventTypes
  - Problem: Current -display.js files lack grp attributes and UI metadata
  - Solution: Schema-driven field generation directly into eventTypes
  - Pattern: AUTO-GENERATED + MANUAL CUSTOMIZATION zones (like existing display files)

  2. GenFields Workflow Created âœ…

  Location: /apps/wf-studio/src/workflows/genFields.js
  - Core Logic: Analyzes qry property â†’ generates field definitions with smart defaults
  - Smart Grouping: Auto-assigns grp numbers based on field name patterns
  - Field Mapping: SQL types â†’ form field types with proper validation
  - Customization: Preserves user overrides in fieldOverrides object

  3. Studio Integration Added âœ…

  Enhanced ComponentDetailCard: Added "ðŸ”„ Generate Fields" button
  - Smart Validation: Only enabled when eventType has qry property
  - User Feedback: Loading states, success/error messages
  - Integration: Calls genFields workflow and updates UI state

  4. Field Attribute Categories Defined âœ…

  AUTO-GENERATED (from SQL schema):
  - name, type, sqlType, maxLength, nullable, isPrimaryKey

  EDITABLE (user customizations):
  - label, required, grp, hint, placeholder, options, validation

  5. Enhanced EventType Structure âœ…

  export const formPlan = {
    qry: "planDtl", // Input for generation

    // ðŸ¤– AUTO-GENERATED ZONE
    fields: [...], // Generated from schema
    schemaMetadata: { generatedFrom: "planDtl" },

    // âœ‹ MANUAL CUSTOMIZATION ZONE
    fieldOverrides: { name: { grp: 1 } },
    customSections: [...]
  };

  ðŸš€ Next Session Priorities

  IMMEDIATE: Fix Import Issues

  - Remove external imports that violate React app constraints
  - Use API calls instead of direct schema analyzer imports
  - Implement server-side schema analysis endpoint

  1. Complete GenFields Integration

  - Create /api/genFields endpoint in wf-server
  - Connect Studio button to server-side schema analysis
  - Test field generation with real planDtl query

  2. Implement Horizontal Field Grouping (grp System)

  - Create CSS grid system for grp attribute rendering
  - Update form components to respect field grouping
  - Test space efficiency improvements in Studio forms

  3. Field Override Management UI

  - Add field customization panel to Studio
  - Allow editing grp, label, hint, placeholder attributes
  - Implement fieldOverrides persistence

  4. Schema Analysis Workflow

  - Integrate with schemaAnalysis.mmd flow
  - Auto-trigger field generation when queries change
  - Support bulk eventType enhancement

  ðŸ’¡ Architecture Insights

  - Config-Driven Development: GenFields follows established pattern of AUTO-GENERATED + MANUAL zones
  - Single Source of Truth: EventTypes become complete component definitions
  - Progressive Enhancement: Start with basic eventTypes, enhance with field generation
  - Modular Design: 172-line workflow stays focused on single responsibility

  ðŸ”§ Technical Foundation Ready

  The genFields system provides the architectural foundation for:
  - Horizontal field grouping throughout the monorepo
  - Schema-driven UI generation
  - Elimination of separate display configuration files
  - Enhanced form layout efficiency with grp attributes

  ---Status: Core workflow architecture complete, ready for server integration and UI implementation! ðŸŽ‰
