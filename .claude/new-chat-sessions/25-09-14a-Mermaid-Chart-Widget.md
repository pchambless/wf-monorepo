Mermaid Chart Widget Implementation - Session Accomplishments

  🎯 Primary Objective

  Fix the chartMermaid widget to properly render interactive mermaid diagrams instead of showing fallback text, and integrate with Studio's workflow system.

  ✅ Major Accomplishments

  1. Global Mermaid Library Loading

  - Problem: Mermaid.js was being loaded on every component mount, causing performance issues
  - Solution: Created modular mermaidLoader.js utility and moved loading to App.jsx startup
  - Files:
    - /apps/wf-studio/src/utils/mermaidLoader.js (new)
    - /apps/wf-studio/src/App.jsx (updated)

  2. Simplified MermaidRenderer Component

  - Problem: Overly complex component with redundant state management and loading logic
  - Solution: Streamlined to 84-line component that assumes mermaid is globally available
  - Files: /apps/wf-studio/src/rendering/PageRenderer/components/MermaidRenderer.jsx (complete rewrite)

  3. Clean CSS Architecture

  - Problem: Inline styles mixed with component logic
  - Solution: Created dedicated CSS file following Studio's established patterns
  - Files: /apps/wf-studio/src/styles/components/mermaid.css (new)

  4. Encapsulated Workflow Trigger

  - Problem: Template resolution failures with {{this.data}} returning "undefined"
  - Solution: Created getMermaidContent trigger that encapsulates API call + contextStore storage
  - Files:
    - /apps/wf-studio/src/rendering/WorkflowEngine/triggers/data/studio/getMermaidContent.js (new)
    - /apps/wf-studio/src/rendering/WorkflowEngine/index.js (updated imports and bindings)

  5. Working Data Flow

  - Before: Complex action chaining with template resolution failures
  - After: Clean flow: getMermaidContent({ path: '...' }) → studioApiCall('getDoc') → setVal('mermaidContent') → render

  🔧 Technical Implementation Details

  Architecture Changes

  // Before (broken):
  onRefresh: [
    { action: "studioApiCall('getDoc', { path: '...' })" },
    { action: "setVal('mermaidContent', '{{this.data}}')" }  // Failed template resolution
  ]

  // After (working):
  onRefresh: [
    { action: "getMermaidContent({ path: 'apps/wf-studio/src/apps/studio/pages/Studio/pageMermaid.mmd' })" }
  ]

  Component Simplification

  - Removed: Complex state management, loading states, subscription logic
  - Added: Direct contextStore access, proper CSS classes
  - Result: Clean, maintainable component that just works

  Performance Improvements

  - Before: Mermaid.js loaded on every component mount (page switches, refreshes)
  - After: Mermaid.js loaded once at app startup, available globally

  🎮 Current Functionality

  ✅ Working Features

  1. Page Selection: Select Studio page → triggers mermaid chart refresh
  2. Interactive Diagram: Full component hierarchy from .mmd file renders correctly
  3. Click Handlers: Nodes are clickable and ready for onChange workflow triggers
  4. Clean UI: Proper placeholder text ("Select a page to view its component hierarchy")
  5. Error Handling: Graceful handling of missing content or API failures

  🔄 Workflow Integration

  - onRefresh: Loads .mmd file content via getMermaidContent trigger
  - onChange: Ready to handle node clicks with setVal('eventTypeID') and notifications
  - Context Store: Proper integration with Studio's state management system

  📁 Files Modified/Created

  New Files

  - /apps/wf-studio/src/utils/mermaidLoader.js - Global mermaid library loader
  - /apps/wf-studio/src/styles/components/mermaid.css - Component styling
  - /apps/wf-studio/src/rendering/WorkflowEngine/triggers/data/studio/getMermaidContent.js - Encapsulated API trigger

  Modified Files

  - /apps/wf-studio/src/App.jsx - Added global mermaid loading
  - /apps/wf-studio/src/rendering/PageRenderer/components/MermaidRenderer.jsx - Complete rewrite for simplicity
  - /apps/wf-studio/src/rendering/WorkflowEngine/index.js - Added getMermaidContent binding
  - /apps/wf-studio/src/apps/studio/pages/Studio/eventTypes/widgets/chartMermaid.js - Updated to use new trigger

  🚀 Next Steps & Opportunities

  Immediate Next Steps

  1. Test Node Click Interactions: Click on mermaid nodes to verify onChange workflow triggers fire correctly
  2. Verify EventType Selection: Ensure setVal('eventTypeID', nodeId) and notifications work
  3. Test Page Switching: Verify different pages load different mermaid content properly

  Architecture Improvements

  1. Dynamic Path Resolution: Make mermaid file paths dynamic based on selected page
  2. Error UI: Better error states instead of empty charts when API calls fail
  3. Caching: Consider caching loaded .mmd content to reduce API calls

  Extensibility

  1. Multi-App Support: Move mermaidLoader.js to shared-imports when other apps need mermaid
  2. Theme Integration: Extend mermaid.css to support Studio themes/dark mode
  3. Performance: Add lazy loading for large mermaid diagrams

  Workflow Engine Patterns

  1. Reusable Triggers: Create more encapsulated triggers following the getMermaidContent pattern
  2. Template Resolution: Fix underlying template resolution issues for future complex workflows
  3. Error Boundaries: Add proper error handling for workflow trigger failures
