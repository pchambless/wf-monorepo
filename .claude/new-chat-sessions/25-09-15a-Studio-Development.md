Studio Development Session - PropRenderer & Database Architecture

  🎯 Session Accomplishments

  PropRenderer Building Block System

  - ✅ Created PropRenderer.jsx - Handles simple prop-driven components (textLine, spacer, divider)
  - ✅ Implemented textLine component - Dynamic text with contextStore integration (getVal('eventTypeID')[1])
  - ✅ CSS class-based styling - Clean .wf-text-* classes instead of inline styles
  - ✅ Updated ComponentRenderer - Routes simple components to PropRenderer

  CSS Architecture Improvements

  - ✅ Modularized base-components.css - Extracted tabs.css, created textLine.css
  - ✅ Removed abandoned accordion - Cleaned up unused CSS classes
  - ✅ Enhanced tab styling - Better padding (12px 20px), hover effects, smooth transitions
  - ✅ Applied tab styles - Added CSS import to TabsRenderer component

  JSON Formatting Enhancement

  - ✅ Replaced custom regex formatter - Implemented json-stringify-pretty-compact
  - ✅ Smart formatting - Objects under 100 chars stay compact, longer ones go multiline
  - ✅ Improved pageConfig readability - Much easier to scan workflow triggers and position objects

  Component Detail Tab Structure

  - ✅ Updated Work Area Tabs - "Mermaid Page | Component Detail | Page Rendered"
  - ✅ Added textLine header - "Event Type: {{eventTypeID}}" with dynamic context
  - ✅ Created sub-tabs structure - EventType Structure, Component Cards, Compare Changes

  Database Architecture Exploration

  - ✅ Created apps table - 5 apps (studio, client, admin, plans, server) with mono_name mapping
  - ✅ Designed eventTypes table - Structured fields (category, title, purpose, cluster) + JSON definition
  - ✅ Discovered server events - API/database events with different pattern than UI components
  - ✅ Numeric ID registry concept - Page-scoped IDs for cleaner references

  EventType Refactoring

  - ✅ Created eventTypeRegistry.js - Numeric ID system for Studio page
  - ✅ Refactored tabEventDtl.js - Clean structure with eventTypeRef instead of nested components
  - ✅ Created stub eventTypes - containerEventStructure, containerEventCards, containerEventChanges

  🚀 Next Steps

  Database Implementation

  - 🔄 Load Studio eventTypes - Insert existing UI components into database
  - 🔄 Load server API events - Insert /server/events into eventTypes table
  - 🔄 Test cross-app queries - Analyze patterns across all 5 apps
  - 🔄 Compare eventType patterns - UI components vs API events structure

  Studio Feature Development

  - 🔄 Implement container rendering - Add container case to ComponentRenderer
  - 🔄 Dynamic Component Detail - Make sub-tabs reactive to selected eventTypeID
  - 🔄 Component Cards system - Template-driven card rendering based on category
  - 🔄 EventType Structure viewer - JSON display with editing capabilities

  PropRenderer Extensions

  - 🔄 Add more prop components - icon, badge, chip, progress, spinner
  - 🔄 Enhanced contextStore integration - Array values, computed values, reactive updates
  - 🔄 Conditional rendering - showIf/hideIf based on context values
  - 🔄 Event handling patterns - Click, hover, focus events for interactive components

  Architecture Decisions

  - 🔄 Database vs Files - Complete database migration or hybrid approach?
  - 🔄 Container system - Finalize container category implementation
  - 🔄 Component Choices column - Template-driven button generation
  - 🔄 Layout adaptability - User maturity-based UI (onboarding vs power users)

  📊 Key Architecture Insights

  PropRenderer Success: Simple prop-driven components (textLine, spacer, divider) work excellently with CSS classes - much cleaner than complex component renderers.

  Database Potential: Unified eventTypes table could handle both UI components (studio/client) and API events (server) with flexible JSON definition field.

  Naming Evolution: EventType names getting unwieldy - numeric IDs provide clean references and refactoring freedom.

  Multi-App Vision: Studio becoming the universal eventType editor for entire monorepo - 5 apps with different patterns but unified management.

  🎯 Session Quality Metrics

  - New Components Created: 5 (PropRenderer, textLine, 3 container stubs)
  - Files Refactored: 3 (tabEventDtl, CSS modules, pageConfig formatter)
  - Architecture Decisions: 2 (PropRenderer pattern, Database exploration)
  - Code Quality: Improved (CSS modularization, JSON formatting, cleaner references)
  - Foundation Set: Multi-app eventType database, PropRenderer building blocks

  Ready for next phase of Studio development! 🚀
