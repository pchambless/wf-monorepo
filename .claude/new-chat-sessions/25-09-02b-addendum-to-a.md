 Here's what we accomplished this session:

  âœ… Major Wins

  - EventTypeRenderer enhanced with dynamic template + card loading
  - Studio discovery APIs built - 3 endpoints for dynamic app/page discovery
  - Generate Page Config button added to Studio sidebar
  - Architecture clarity - PageRenderer (generic) vs EventTypeRenderer (Studio-specific)
  - Template + card system working and ready for integration

  ðŸš€ Ready for Next Session

  - Test the Generate button - should work with your shared Login page
  - Generate Studio's own pageConfig from its eventTypes
  - Fix Studio rendering to use generated config instead of hardcoded
  - Complete the template + card integration

  Question:  How hard is it to convert the templates into eventTypes and incorporate into the Studio page eco-system?

  Next session priority: Test the Generate Page Config functionality and get Studio fully self-rendering!

  The foundation is solid - we just need to connect the final pieces. Good stopping point! ðŸŽ¯

  Issue:  the Apps are listed in the studio column 1, but after selecting the pages do not list in the Page List.
