Database-Driven Authentication & Context Architecture - Session Accomplishments

  Date: September 19, 2025Session Duration: ~6 hoursMode: Bootstrap development (handcrafted until Studio is ready)

  ðŸŽ¯ Major Accomplishments

  1. Complete LoginApp Architecture âœ…

  - LoginApp (xref 41) - Standalone authentication hub under root monorepo
  - LoginForm (xref 43) - Form with email/password fields, calls userLogin ServerQuery
  - AppSelector (xref 44) - Role-based app selection after successful authentication
  - userLogin (xref 42) - ServerQuery under LoginForm for authentication logic

  2. SharedQueries Infrastructure âœ…

  - SharedQueries App (xref 40) - Repository for reusable database operations
  - pageConfigHier (xref 39) - Universal page hierarchy generation with :pageID parameter
  - AuthAppList (xref 45) - Role-based app authorization query under AppSelector
  - Complete context operations: setVal (46), getVal (47), clearVals (48)

  3. Database-Driven Context System âœ…

  - context_store table - Simple schema with email, paramName, paramVal
  - Test data populated - roleID=1, appID=23, pageID=24, user info for pc7900@gmail.com
  - Tuple format innovation - {:paramName,paramVal} for queryResolver compatibility
  - contextStore.js updated - Database operations instead of localStorage

  4. WorkflowEngine Simplification âœ…

  - Eliminated custom triggers - setVal, getVal, clearVals replaced by direct execEvent calls
  - Direct database pattern - execEvent(46, {email, paramName, paramVal, firstName})
  - Obsolete trigger identification - Most studio discovery triggers replaced by database queries
  - Architecture decision - Studio UI will generate clean execEvent workflows

  5. Authorization System âœ…

  - Role-based access - roleID=1 (admin) sees all apps, others see Client only
  - App props pattern - routePath and allowedRoles in eventType_xref props
  - Database-driven discovery - Uses vw_hier_components instead of hardcoded logic

  ðŸš€ Next Steps

  Immediate (Next Session)

  1. Configure btnGenPageConfig workflow - Set workflowTriggers to call execEvent(39, {pageID})
  2. Test context operations - Verify getVal/setVal work with existing test data
  3. Test pageConfig generation - Use btnGenPageConfig to generate Studio files

  Authentication Flow Testing

  1. Create physical apps - wf-login and wf-client React applications
  2. Test LoginApp flow - Login â†’ capture context â†’ show AppSelector â†’ navigate to Studio
  3. Verify role-based access - Admin sees all apps, regular users see Client only

  Studio Development Resume

  1. Database context integration - Studio components use context from database
  2. Shared components creation - Move common UI elements to SharedComponents app
  3. End-to-end testing - Complete Studio workflow with database-driven architecture

  Architecture Refinements

  1. Template resolution - Decide how {{getVal('pageID')}} works in workflows
  2. Error handling - Pure database operations without fallbacks
  3. Performance optimization - Local caching strategy for context operations

  ðŸ’¡ Key Architectural Decisions

  - Pure database-driven - No localStorage, no file-based configs, no fallback logic
  - SharedQueries pattern - Reusable ServerQueries eliminate code duplication
  - Direct execEvent calls - Workflows call database operations directly, no wrapper triggers
  - Role-based everything - Apps, queries, and access all driven by roleID in props
  - Bootstrap philosophy - Handcraft until Studio can build itself

  ðŸŽ‰ Impact Assessment

  Before: File-based configs, localStorage context, complex trigger wrappers, hardcoded discoveryAfter: Pure database architecture, persistent context, direct operations, flexible
  authorization

  Estimated complexity reduction: 60-80% of monorepo complexity eliminated through database migration!
