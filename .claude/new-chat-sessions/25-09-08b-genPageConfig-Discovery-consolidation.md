Server Consolidation Milestone - Discovery Orchestration Complete

  ðŸŽ¯ Major Accomplishments

  âœ… EventType Discovery Consolidation

  - Problem: discoverEventTypes and genPageConfig had duplicate file discovery logic
  - Solution: Consolidated both to use same AST parsing from loadEventTypeFromFile
  - Result: Single source of truth for eventType discovery at page-level scope
  - Impact: 8 eventTypes properly discovered and categorized (select, grid, page, column, tab, tabs)

  âœ… Template Discovery Enhancement

  - Problem: discoverTemplates returned basic metadata, templateRegistry did separate AST parsing
  - Solution: Enhanced discoverTemplates with full AST parsing to extract detailCards arrays
  - Result: Rich template intelligence in single endpoint
  - Impact: 12 templates parsed with complete metadata (e.g., grid â†’ cards: basics,dbQuery,gridOverrides,workflowTriggers,workflows)

  âœ… Orchestration Pattern Implementation

  - Problem: Duplicate scanning logic across multiple files
  - Solution: templateRegistry now uses execTemplates â†’ discoverTemplates internally
  - Result: genPageConfig orchestrates discovery endpoints instead of duplicating logic
  - Impact: Clean separation - discovery endpoints serve Studio UI, genPageConfig uses same data for processing

  âœ… Studio Intelligence Foundation

  - Problem: Studio ComponentDetail tabs had no rich template data
  - Solution: discoverTemplates now provides full parsed template objects with detailCards
  - Result: Studio can display appropriate cards for each template type
  - Impact: Foundation ready for ComponentDetail tab implementation

  âœ… Logging & Debugging Enhancement

  - Before: Generic logging with counts
  - After: Detailed logging showing actual card names
  - Example: template: grid -> cards: basics,dbQuery,gridOverrides,workflowTriggers,workflows
  - Impact: Excellent debugging visibility for template intelligence

  ðŸš€ Next Steps

  1. Accordion EventTypes Implementation

  - Goal: Implement accordionEvents widget with eventType hierarchy
  - Data Source: Use discoverEventTypes endpoint (already returning categorized data)
  - UI Structure: Categories as accordion sections (Page, Columns, Grids, Selectors, Tabs)
  - Action: Create execEventTypes WorkflowEngine action for accordion refresh

  2. AccordionRenderer Component

  - Goal: Create vanilla React accordion component (following UI strategy)
  - Requirements: Collapsible sections, category-based organization
  - Integration: Wire with onRefresh: ["execEventTypes"] workflow triggers
  - Styling: CSS-driven, consistent with existing Studio components

  3. Studio ComponentDetail Tabs

  - Goal: Implement rich ComponentDetail using template detailCards
  - Data Source: Enhanced discoverTemplates endpoint with full template objects
  - Cards: Dynamic card loading based on template's detailCards array
  - Examples: Grid templates show 5 cards, simple templates show basic cards only

  4. Complete Studio Workflow Testing

  - Scope: End-to-end testing of App â†’ Page â†’ EventType selection flow
  - Validation: Verify refresh actions work across all components
  - Integration: Ensure accordion, selectors, and ComponentDetail work together
  - Polish: Fine-tune logging and error handling

  ðŸ“Š Technical Metrics

  - Files Consolidated: 3 discovery logic implementations â†’ 1 shared system
  - Code Duplication Eliminated: ~200 lines of duplicate file scanning logic
  - API Intelligence Enhanced: 12 templates with rich metadata vs. basic file lists
  - Discovery Endpoints: 4 endpoints (discoverApps, discoverPages, discoverTemplates, discoverEventTypes)
  - Orchestration Achieved: genPageConfig â†’ discovery endpoints (no direct file access)

  ðŸŽŠ Status: MILESTONE COMPLETE

  Server consolidation successful - ready for Studio UI implementation phase!
