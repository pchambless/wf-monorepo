  Focus: Built and tested complete impact logging system for Claude/Kiro coordination with virtual batch_id column and flexible querying
  Primary AI: Claude

  Check Recent Impacts:
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/execEventType \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"eventType": "planImpactList", "eventSQLId": 24, "params": {"created_by": null}}'

  Session Impacts Logged:
  - IMPACT-LOGGING.md - Documentation updates (batch_id: claude-2025-10-18 1027)
  - apps/server/server/utils/impactLogger.js - Removed batch_id generation (batch_id: claude-2025-10-18 1027)
  - impact-cli.mjs - Fixed auto-find latest session (batch_id: kiro-20251018-0900)
  - packages/shared-imports/src/api/index.js - Fixed duplicate exports (batch_id: kiro-20251018-0900)

  Handoff Points:
  - For Kiro: Test impact logging system once on native Linux (not WSL)
  - For Kiro: Use direct API endpoint for logging impacts during implementation
  - For Claude: Monitor coordination effectiveness over next few sessions

  ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

  1. Impact Logging System Testing & Fixes

  - Fixed impact-cli.mjs to auto-find latest session when submitting
  - Fixed duplicate FileImpactLogger export in packages/shared-imports/src/api/index.js
  - Added api_wf schema prefix to plan_impacts table in impactLogger.js
  - Tested end-to-end: create session ‚Üí add impacts ‚Üí submit ‚Üí cleanup

  2. Virtual Batch ID Column

  - Database now auto-generates batch_id from created_by + created_at
  - Removed hardcoded batch_id generation from server code
  - Format: claude-2025-10-18 1027 or kiro-2025-10-18 1012
  - Ensures correct agent attribution without code maintenance

  3. Enhanced Query System

  - Updated planImpactList query to 7-day history (was 1 day)
  - Added optional created_by parameter for filtering
  - Limit set to 30 records (good balance for coordination)
  - Supports both filtered and unfiltered views

  4. Documentation Updates

  - Clarified AI agents should use direct API endpoint (most efficient)
  - Human developers use CLI tool for better workflow
  - Added examples for filtered vs unfiltered impact queries
  - Documented virtual column behavior

  5. AI Orchestration in Session Summaries

  - Enhanced /summary command with AI Coordination section
  - Includes impact query command for easy copy/paste
  - Added handoff points for Claude/Kiro/Copilot coordination
  - Tracks batch_ids in statistics

  üöÄ Next Steps

  Immediate (Next Session)

  1. Test {pageName} template - Complete CRUD workflow from previous session
  2. Log all impacts - Use new system for all file changes going forward
  3. Monitor coordination - Check planImpactList before starting work

  Short Term

  4. Build template cloning - Hierarchical cloning: {pageName} ‚Üí recipes with ID remapping
  5. Add form submit workflow - Verify captureFormData ‚Üí execDML ‚Üí refresh chain
  6. Kiro coordination test - Once on native Linux, test impact logging from both AIs

  Future

  7. Planner app integration - Consider if existing planner app should integrate with impact logging
  8. Impact analytics - Track which files/apps change most frequently
  9. Cross-session coordination - Use impacts to resume context across sessions

  üí° Key Learnings

  Virtual Generated Columns

  - MySQL virtual columns auto-compute values from other columns
  - Can't insert/update them directly - they're read-only
  - Perfect for derived values like batch_id = created_by + timestamp
  - Eliminates code maintenance and ensures consistency

  AI Coordination Patterns

  - File-based coordination (CLI) works for humans and native Linux
  - API-based coordination works everywhere (WSL, native, any environment)
  - Readable batch IDs (claude-2025-10-18 1027) beat UUIDs for debugging
  - 7-day history with 30 record limit is good balance for context

  Token Efficiency in API Calls

  - Single API call with multiple impacts > multiple CLI commands
  - Direct endpoint preferred for AIs, CLI for humans/scripts
  - Filtering by agent (created_by) allows focused coordination checks

  Session Documentation

  - Including impact queries in summaries improves continuity
  - Handoff points make multi-AI coordination explicit
  - Batch IDs in statistics provide traceable history

  üìù Code Snippets

  Log impacts (AI agents):
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/logImpact \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "impacts": [
        {
          "filePath": "path/to/file.js",
          "changeType": "modify",
          "description": "What was changed",
          "affectedApps": ["server", "client"],
          "createdBy": "claude"
        }
      ],
      "planId": 1
    }'

  Check recent impacts:
  # All agents
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/execEventType \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"eventType": "planImpactList", "eventSQLId": 24, "params": {"created_by": null}}'

  # Specific agent
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/execEventType \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"eventType": "planImpactList", "eventSQLId": 24, "params": {"created_by": "kiro"}}'

  Status: Impact logging system fully operational and tested. Ready for use in all future sessions. Virtual batch_id ensures correct attribution. Query system supports coordination
  between Claude, Kiro, and future AIs. üöÄ
