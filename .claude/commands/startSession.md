# Fetch Recent Summaries

This command uses the shared session startup specification.

See: `.shared/commands/startSession.md` for complete instructions and curl commands.

## Claude-Specific Implementation

1. Run curl commands to fetch recent session context
2. Display recent AI summaries (last 2)
3. Display recent plan impacts (last 24 hours)
4. Ready for user task assignment

This ensures consistent AI coordination across Claude and Kiro sessions.
