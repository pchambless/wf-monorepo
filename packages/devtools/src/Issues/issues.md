1.  I think this is the Appbar.  It should match the background color of the sidebar (the light green)
2.  None of the links in the sidebar work (e.g. clicking the Ingredients should navigate to the 01-ingrTypeList page.  This is something I should probably simplify, as it is currently trying to navigate to http://localhost:3000/ingrTypeList)  My page naming could be changed to make it just ingrTypeList, but this will take changes to the the folder naming and the filenames.  This may be a worthwile endeaver.  Alternatively, we can enhance the /home/paul/wf-monorepo-new/apps/wf-client/src/config/navigation.js generation to have the actual page route, which is in the pageMapRegistry.  It might be that this would be better located in the events as another attribute...         pageIndexPath: '2-Ingredient/01-ingrTypeList/index.jsx' 
3.  Login page... it is not picking up the shared logo.
