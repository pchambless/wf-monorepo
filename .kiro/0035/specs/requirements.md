# Client-Side Workflow Architecture Requirements

## Introduction

Plan 35 establishes a comprehensive client-side workflow architecture in `/packages/shared-imports/src/architecture/workflows` that encapsulates common patterns for plan operations, communication flows, impact management, and user experience consistency. This architecture builds upon the Plan 34 context refresh system to provide standardized workflow patterns that can be reused across all client-side operations.

The system will replace the current analysis/guidance workflow pattern with a streamlined approach where comprehensive guidance is built directly into plan descriptions, eliminating the need for separate analysis and guidance phases. This creates a more efficient development process: Plan Description → Requirements → Design → Implementation.

The workflow architecture will provide a unified approach to handling complex multi-step workflows with proper state management, error handling, and user feedback mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Plan Operations Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized workflow patterns for plan operations, so that create/update/archive operations are consistent and include automatic impact tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a plan THEN the workflow SHALL automatically initialize impact tracking for the new plan
2. WHEN updating a plan THEN the workflow SHALL record the change in the impact tracking system with proper categorization
3. WHEN archiving a plan THEN the workflow SHALL set deleted_at timestamp and active=0 for soft delete, preserving all impact records and historical data
4. WHEN plan operations complete THEN the workflow SHALL trigger context refresh notifications to update dependent components
5. WHEN plan operations fail THEN the workflow SHALL provide consistent error handling with user-friendly messages

### Requirement 2: Communication Flow Workflow

**User Story:** As a user, I want communication workflows to handle message creation and coordination seamlessly, so that agent handoffs are smooth and properly tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a communication THEN the workflow SHALL store the message in the database and return a communication ID
2. WHEN communication is created THEN the workflow SHALL trigger the appropriate coordination modal based on the communication type
3. WHEN coordination modal is triggered THEN the workflow SHALL provide the user with the correct message template for the target agent
4. WHEN communication workflow completes THEN dependent components SHALL refresh to show the new communication
5. WHEN communication workflow fails THEN the user SHALL receive clear error messages with retry options

### Requirement 3: Impact Management Workflow

**User Story:** As a system, I want automatic impact tracking with proper categorization, so that all file changes and plan activities are recorded consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations occur THEN the workflow SHALL automatically categorize impacts as CREATE, MODIFY, DELETE, ANALYZE, DISCOVER, COMMUNICATE, or PLAN
2. WHEN impacts are recorded THEN the workflow SHALL associate them with the correct plan and phase (idea, development, adhoc) - eliminating separate analysis and guidance phases
3. WHEN impacts are created THEN the workflow SHALL determine the appropriate userID based on the agent performing the action
4. WHEN impact workflows complete THEN the impact tracking components SHALL refresh to show updated data
5. WHEN impact categorization is uncertain THEN the workflow SHALL use appropriate defaults and log the decision

### Requirement 4: Error Handling Patterns

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent error handling across all workflows, so that I always know what went wrong and how to recover.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with specific details
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL highlight the specific fields that need correction
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging while showing simplified messages to users
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL allow users to continue their workflow from where they left off

### Requirement 5: Context Integration Workflow

**User Story:** As a component, I want workflows to trigger appropriate refresh notifications, so that the UI stays synchronized when data changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows modify plan data THEN the system SHALL trigger plan context refresh notifications
2. WHEN workflows create communications THEN the system SHALL refresh communication history components
3. WHEN workflows update impact data THEN the system SHALL refresh impact tracking displays
4. WHEN context refresh is triggered THEN only affected components SHALL reload their data
5. WHEN multiple workflows run simultaneously THEN context refresh notifications SHALL be batched to avoid excessive updates

### Requirement 6: Workflow Orchestration Patterns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized orchestration patterns, so that complex workflows can be composed from simpler building blocks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining workflows THEN developers SHALL use a consistent workflow definition pattern with steps, conditions, and error handling
2. WHEN workflows have dependencies THEN the system SHALL ensure prerequisite steps complete before proceeding
3. WHEN workflows need to branch THEN the system SHALL support conditional execution based on data or user choices
4. WHEN workflows need to run in parallel THEN the system SHALL coordinate parallel execution and result aggregation
5. WHEN workflows are composed THEN the system SHALL maintain clear execution context and state throughout the process

### Requirement 7: State Management Across Workflows

**User Story:** As a workflow, I want reliable state management across complex multi-step processes, so that data is consistent and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows begin THEN the system SHALL initialize workflow state with all necessary context data
2. WHEN workflow steps execute THEN the system SHALL maintain state consistency across step transitions
3. WHEN workflows are interrupted THEN the system SHALL preserve state to allow resumption
4. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary state while preserving results
5. WHEN multiple workflows interact THEN the system SHALL prevent state conflicts and ensure data integrity

### Requirement 8: Component Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a workflow step, I want proper lifecycle management, so that components are initialized, updated, and cleaned up correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow steps mount THEN components SHALL initialize with the correct workflow context
2. WHEN workflow steps update THEN components SHALL receive new state and re-render appropriately
3. WHEN workflow steps unmount THEN components SHALL clean up subscriptions and resources
4. WHEN workflow steps fail THEN components SHALL handle errors gracefully and maintain UI stability
5. WHEN workflow steps complete THEN components SHALL transition smoothly to the next step or completion state

### Requirement 9: Progress Tracking and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear progress tracking and feedback during workflow execution, so that I understand what's happening and how long it will take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows start THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators with estimated completion time
2. WHEN workflow steps complete THEN the system SHALL update progress indicators and show step completion
3. WHEN workflows are processing THEN the system SHALL provide loading states and prevent user interference
4. WHEN workflows take longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide status updates and allow cancellation
5. WHEN workflows complete THEN the system SHALL show success confirmation with summary of actions taken

### Requirement 10: Integration Patterns Between Workflow Types

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want standardized integration patterns between different workflow types, so that workflows can interact seamlessly and share data appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflows need to trigger other workflows THEN the system SHALL provide a standard workflow invocation pattern
2. WHEN workflows need to share data THEN the system SHALL use consistent data passing mechanisms
3. WHEN workflows need to wait for other workflows THEN the system SHALL provide synchronization primitives
4. WHEN workflows need to aggregate results THEN the system SHALL support result collection and merging patterns
5. WHEN workflow integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities
