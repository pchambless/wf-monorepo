# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Agent-Based Task Assignment System represents an evolution from the current complexity-based task assignment (1,2,3,4 scoring) to an expertise-based agent assignment system. This system will improve task quality through specialized domain knowledge by routing tasks to agents with specific expertise rather than generic model selection based on complexity alone.

The system will maintain the existing workflow engine infrastructure while enhancing the task routing mechanism to leverage specialized agents for better outcomes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a workflow engine, I want to route tasks to specialized agents based on domain expertise, so that task quality improves through better expert-task matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is submitted to the workflow engine THEN the system SHALL analyze the task domain and route it to the appropriate specialized agent
2. WHEN no specialized agent is available for a task domain THEN the system SHALL use fallback routing strategies to ensure task completion
3. WHEN multiple agents can handle a task THEN the system SHALL select the agent with the highest expertise match score

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage agent capabilities and availability, so that the routing system can make informed assignment decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is registered THEN the system SHALL store the agent's expertise domains, capabilities, and availability status
2. WHEN agent availability changes THEN the system SHALL update the routing decisions for pending tasks
3. WHEN a new agent type is needed THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for agent specializations to fill capability gaps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a task creator, I want tasks to include domain and expertise metadata, so that the routing engine can make accurate agent assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL replace complexity scoring (1,2,3,4) with agent assignment metadata
2. WHEN task metadata is defined THEN the system SHALL include domain, expertise requirements, and context fields
3. WHEN tasks have dependencies THEN the system SHALL track relationships between different agent specializations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a workflow engine, I want intelligent agent selection with context optimization, so that each agent receives appropriately sized context for their specialty.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting an agent for a task THEN the system SHALL optimize context size based on the agent's specialty requirements
2. WHEN the primary agent is unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement fallback strategies to alternative agents
3. WHEN context exceeds agent limits THEN the system SHALL intelligently trim context while preserving essential information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system analyst, I want to track quality metrics and agent performance, so that the system can continuously improve task-expert matching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks are completed THEN the system SHALL measure task outcome quality by assigned agent
2. WHEN expertise matching occurs THEN the system SHALL track the effectiveness of agent-task pairings
3. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL provide optimization recommendations for agent assignments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to identify and suggest new agent specializations, so that capability gaps can be filled to enhance overall system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing task patterns THEN the system SHALL identify domains where specialized agents would improve outcomes
2. WHEN capability gaps are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest specific agent specializations (e.g., layoutParser, queryParser for Events domain)
3. WHEN new agents are proposed THEN the system SHALL provide clear justification based on task volume and complexity patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a workflow engine, I want seamless integration with existing agent infrastructure, so that the transition from complexity-based to expertise-based routing is smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing agents THEN the system SHALL leverage the current `.claude/agents` directory structure
2. WHEN migrating from complexity scoring THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility during the transition period
3. WHEN interfacing with future workflow engines THEN the system SHALL provide clean APIs for task routing and agent management
