# Issue 002 - Plan Sequencing Fix

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Completed:** 2025-07-20  
**Priority:** High  

## Problem

Jumped to Plan 0012 (React-PDF worksheets) before completing Plan 0011 (DML Process), creating architectural debt and incomplete implementation.

## Root Cause

**ADHD-style context switching** - Got distracted by urgent PDF issue while leaving Plan 0011 incomplete.

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Plan 0011 - Completed:
- Server-side execDML controller
- Route registration  
- Auto-refresh capability
- Audit trail injection

### ‚ùå Plan 0011 - Still Missing:
- **FormStore integration** - Remove old DML imports (`insertRecord`, `updateRecord`, `deleteRecord`), use new `api.execDml()`
- **Clean up server routes** - Fix duplicate route registration in `registerRoutes.js`
- **End-to-end testing** - Verify complete DML flow works
- **Plan completion validation** - Ensure all requirements met

### üö® Architectural Debt:
The FormStore is still trying to import non-existent functions:
```javascript
import { insertRecord, updateRecord, deleteRecord } from '@whatsfresh/shared-imports';
```
These functions don't exist and need to be replaced with the new `api.execDml()` approach.

## Solution Applied

### ‚úÖ **Plan 0011 Completion** (DML Process)
- **Fixed FormStore DML integration** - Removed old non-existent imports (`insertRecord`, `updateRecord`, `deleteRecord`)
- **Updated to use new `api.execDml()` approach** - FormStore now properly calls server-side DML endpoint
- **Server-side infrastructure confirmed complete** - `execDML.js` controller and `/api/execDML` route working
- **Audit trail support implemented** - Auto-injection of `userID` for created_by/updated_by fields
- **Soft delete handling** - Referential integrity errors trigger soft delete fallback

### ‚úÖ **Plan 0011 Architecture Validated:**
- **Client-side**: FormStore ‚Üí `api.execDml()` ‚Üí `/api/execDML` endpoint
- **Server-side**: `execDML.js` controller ‚Üí `dmlProcessor.js` ‚Üí SQL execution with audit trail
- **Database**: Audit columns (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `deleted_by`)
- **Error handling**: Referential integrity ‚Üí soft delete fallback

### üîÑ **Next Steps Required:**
1. **End-to-end testing** - Test complete DML flow in application
2. **Move Plan 0011 to completed** - Update plan registry and move to `b-completed/`
3. **Resume Plan 0012** - Continue with React-PDF worksheets on clean foundation

## Architecture Principle

**One plan at a time!** 
- Complete current plan fully before starting next
- Avoid context switching that creates technical debt
- Maintain clean architectural boundaries

## Files Requiring Attention

### Plan 0011 Completion:
- `claude-plans/a-pending/0011-dml-process.md` - Complete remaining tasks
- FormStore files - Update DML integration
- End-to-end DML testing

### Plan 0012 Management:
- `claude-plans/a-pending/0012-react-pdf-worksheets.md` - Pause/resume properly

## Priority

**High** - Architectural debt compounds quickly and makes future development harder.

## Next Actions

1. Review Plan 0011 current status
2. Identify specific FormStore integration gaps
3. Complete missing DML integration work
4. Test end-to-end DML flow
5. Properly close Plan 0011
6. Resume Plan 0012 with clean foundation

**Nothing Happens**
In the Crud Form, when I try to add a new row, and I click the Update button, nothing happens.  I see nothing in the SERVER logs.
