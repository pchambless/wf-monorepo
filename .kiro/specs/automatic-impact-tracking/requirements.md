# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will automatically track plan impacts whenever modules are modified during development work. Currently, impact tracking is a manual process that requires developers to remember to create impact records after making changes. This leads to inconsistent tracking and potential gaps in plan documentation. The system should automatically detect file modifications and create appropriate impact records in the database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on a plan, I want file modifications to automatically generate impact records, so that I don't have to manually track every change.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is modified during plan work THEN the system SHALL automatically create an impact record in api_wf.plan_impacts
2. WHEN multiple files are modified in a single operation THEN the system SHALL create separate impact records for each file
3. WHEN a file modification occurs THEN the system SHALL capture the file path, change type, and description automatically
4. IF no active plan context exists THEN the system SHALL prompt for plan association or skip impact tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to intelligently determine the change type and description, so that impact records are meaningful and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new file is created THEN the system SHALL set change_type to "CREATE"
2. WHEN an existing file is modified THEN the system SHALL set change_type to "MODIFY"
3. WHEN a file is deleted THEN the system SHALL set change_type to "DELETE"
4. WHEN generating descriptions THEN the system SHALL include context about what was changed and why
5. WHEN the change is part of a larger feature THEN the system SHALL reference the feature context in the description

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to determine plan association through practical methods that work in all development scenarios, so that impacts are tracked regardless of UI state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contextStore contains a planID THEN the system SHALL use that plan for impact tracking
2. WHEN the user explicitly specifies a plan ID THEN the system SHALL use that plan for impact tracking
3. WHEN working within a .kiro/specs/{plan-name} directory THEN the system SHALL derive the plan ID from the guidance document or folder context
4. WHEN Claude provides plan context in guidance THEN the system SHALL extract and use the plan ID from that guidance
5. WHEN no plan context can be determined THEN the system SHALL allow manual specification or skip tracking
6. IF the user explicitly opts out THEN the system SHALL skip impact tracking entirely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to batch impact tracking for related changes, so that I can group modifications that belong together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple files are modified for the same feature THEN the system SHALL allow batching impacts with a common description prefix
2. WHEN batching is enabled THEN the system SHALL prompt for a batch description that applies to all changes
3. WHEN individual file descriptions are needed THEN the system SHALL combine batch description with file-specific details
4. WHEN batching is complete THEN the system SHALL insert all impact records in a single transaction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be configurable and non-intrusive, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN impact tracking is enabled THEN file operations SHALL complete normally with minimal performance impact
2. WHEN impact tracking fails THEN file operations SHALL still succeed and log the tracking failure
3. WHEN the developer wants to disable tracking THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle mechanism
4. WHEN working on non-plan related changes THEN the system SHALL allow skipping impact tracking entirely
5. WHEN the system detects rapid file changes THEN it SHALL debounce impact creation to avoid spam

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see comprehensive impact tracking across all development work, so that I can understand the full scope of changes for each plan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing plan impacts THEN all automatically tracked changes SHALL be visible alongside manual entries
2. WHEN impact records are created automatically THEN they SHALL include timestamps and user attribution
3. WHEN reviewing plan progress THEN automatic impacts SHALL provide clear traceability of what was changed
4. WHEN generating plan reports THEN automatic impacts SHALL be included in change summaries
