# Implementation Guidance: Plan 0029 - completePlan Workflow

## Summary
Create completePlan.js workflow to connect existing UI completion button to backend plan completion logic.

## Core Implementation

### 1. Create completePlan.js Workflow
**Location**: `/packages/shared-imports/src/architecture/workflows/plans/completePlan.js`

Follow createPlan.js pattern:
- Update plan status to "completed" 
- Set completion timestamp
- Create completion record in plan_documents if needed
- Use createDoc helper for any completion documentation
- Return success/failure status for UI feedback

### 2. Connect UI to Workflow
- Locate existing completion button in plan management interface
- Wire button to call completePlan workflow
- Handle success/error responses
- Update UI state after completion

### 3. Workflow Helper Enhancements
- createDoc.js helper already created and working
- Update analysis/guidance creation workflows to use shared helper
- Migrate from direct execCreateDoc calls to createDoc helper
- Ensure co-located templates work across all workflows

### 4. Testing Plan
- Test completePlan workflow with Plan 0029 itself
- Verify impact tracking works correctly
- Validate UI button triggers workflow properly
- Check plan status updates in database

## Implementation Notes
- UI completion button already exists - just needs backend connection
- Leverage existing createPlan.js as template
- Use shared createDoc helper for consistency
- Track all changes to Plan 0000 during development

## Success Criteria
- [ ] completePlan.js workflow created and functional
- [ ] UI button successfully completes plans
- [ ] Impact tracking works for completion workflow
- [ ] Plan 0029 can complete itself using new workflow
