# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will automatically track plan impacts whenever modules are modified during development work across the entire monorepo. Currently, impact tracking is a manual process that requires developers to remember to create impact records after making changes. This leads to inconsistent tracking and potential gaps in plan documentation, especially for changes that span multiple apps (like auth, eventTypes, or shared utilities). The system should automatically detect file modifications at the monorepo level and create appropriate impact records that capture the full scope of cross-app changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer working on a plan, I want file modifications across the entire monorepo to automatically generate impact records, so that I don't have to manually track every change including cross-app impacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are modified anywhere in the monorepo during plan work THEN the system SHALL automatically create impact records in api_wf.plan_impacts
2. WHEN multiple files are modified across different apps THEN the system SHALL group related changes into cohesive impact records that show the full scope
3. WHEN a file modification occurs THEN the system SHALL capture the relative path from monorepo root, affected app(s), change type, and description automatically
4. WHEN changes affect shared resources (auth, eventTypes, utilities) THEN the system SHALL identify and document potential cross-app impacts
5. IF no active plan context exists THEN the system SHALL prompt for plan association or skip impact tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to intelligently determine the change type and description, so that impact records are meaningful and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new file is created THEN the system SHALL set change_type to "CREATE"
2. WHEN an existing file is modified THEN the system SHALL set change_type to "MODIFY"
3. WHEN a file is deleted THEN the system SHALL set change_type to "DELETE"
4. WHEN generating descriptions THEN the system SHALL include context about what was changed and why
5. WHEN the change is part of a larger feature THEN the system SHALL reference the feature context in the description

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to determine plan association through practical methods that work in all development scenarios, so that impacts are tracked regardless of UI state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contextStore contains a planID THEN the system SHALL use that plan for impact tracking
2. WHEN the user explicitly specifies a plan ID THEN the system SHALL use that plan for impact tracking
3. WHEN working within a .kiro/specs/{plan-name} directory THEN the system SHALL derive the plan ID from the guidance document or folder context
4. WHEN Claude provides plan context in guidance THEN the system SHALL extract and use the plan ID from that guidance
5. WHEN no plan context can be determined THEN the system SHALL allow manual specification or skip tracking
6. IF the user explicitly opts out THEN the system SHALL skip impact tracking entirely

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to batch impact tracking for related changes, so that I can group modifications that belong together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple files are modified for the same feature THEN the system SHALL allow batching impacts with a common description prefix
2. WHEN batching is enabled THEN the system SHALL prompt for a batch description that applies to all changes
3. WHEN individual file descriptions are needed THEN the system SHALL combine batch description with file-specific details
4. WHEN batching is complete THEN the system SHALL insert all impact records in a single transaction

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be configurable and non-intrusive, so that it doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN impact tracking is enabled THEN file operations SHALL complete normally with minimal performance impact
2. WHEN impact tracking fails THEN file operations SHALL still succeed and log the tracking failure
3. WHEN the developer wants to disable tracking THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle mechanism
4. WHEN working on non-plan related changes THEN the system SHALL allow skipping impact tracking entirely
5. WHEN the system detects rapid file changes THEN it SHALL debounce impact creation to avoid spam

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to intelligently detect and group cross-app impacts, so that related changes are tracked together rather than as isolated file modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are made to shared utilities or auth components THEN the system SHALL identify which apps are potentially affected
2. WHEN eventType definitions are modified THEN the system SHALL flag both server and client app impacts
3. WHEN database schema changes occur THEN the system SHALL identify all apps that use the affected tables
4. WHEN changes span multiple apps in a single development session THEN the system SHALL group them under a single impact record with detailed breakdown
5. WHEN cross-app dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL include dependency analysis in the impact description

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to see comprehensive impact tracking across all development work, so that I can understand the full scope of changes for each plan.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing plan impacts THEN all automatically tracked changes SHALL be visible alongside manual entries with clear app attribution
2. WHEN impact records are created automatically THEN they SHALL include timestamps, user attribution, and affected app scope
3. WHEN reviewing plan progress THEN automatic impacts SHALL provide clear traceability of what was changed across the entire monorepo
4. WHEN generating plan reports THEN automatic impacts SHALL be included in change summaries with cross-app dependency analysis
5. WHEN impacts span multiple apps THEN the system SHALL provide a consolidated view showing the full scope of changes

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer using the plan management interface, I want impact tracking to integrate seamlessly with the plan management UI components, so that I can see real-time impact visualization within my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working in the plan management interface THEN the tab-planImpacts component SHALL display automatically tracked impacts in real-time
2. WHEN impacts are created through form-planDetail interactions THEN they SHALL immediately appear in the grid-planImpactList
3. WHEN using grid-planList operations THEN impact tracking SHALL occur transparently without disrupting the user experience
4. WHEN viewing plan communications THEN related impacts SHALL be cross-referenced and accessible
5. WHEN plan status changes occur THEN the system SHALL automatically track these as significant impacts

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want different workflows to generate contextually appropriate impact records, so that the impact tracking reflects the specific type of work being performed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the createPlan workflow executes THEN the system SHALL create an impact record indicating plan creation with initial scope
2. WHEN the updatePlan workflow executes THEN the system SHALL track changes to plan metadata and status transitions
3. WHEN the trackImpact workflow executes THEN the system SHALL create detailed impact records with full context and dependencies
4. WHEN the createRecord or updateRecord workflows execute THEN the system SHALL track data changes with appropriate granularity
5. WHEN the createCommunication workflow executes THEN the system SHALL link communication impacts to the associated plan context
