# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The createDoc utility is a foundational file creation utility that enables programmatic document creation for the WhatsFresh monorepo's document automation system. This utility will serve as the core building block for agent-driven document workflows, plan creation, and analysis document generation, dramatically reducing token usage by enabling efficient document creation instead of verbose inline content generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the document automation system, I want a reliable file creation utility, so that I can programmatically create documents with proper directory structure and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN createDoc is called with valid parameters THEN the system SHALL create the specified file with the provided content
2. WHEN the target directory does not exist THEN the system SHALL create the directory structure recursively
3. WHEN the file creation is successful THEN the system SHALL return a success response with the full file path
4. WHEN file creation fails THEN the system SHALL return a detailed error response with the failure reason

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want the file creation utility to prevent path traversal attacks, so that malicious code cannot create files outside the project directory.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file path attempts to traverse outside the project directory THEN the system SHALL reject the operation with a security error
2. WHEN a filename contains invalid characters THEN the system SHALL reject the operation with a validation error
3. WHEN the resolved path is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure it stays within the project boundaries
4. WHEN filename validation occurs THEN the system SHALL only allow alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and dots

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with existing files, I want the utility to handle file overwrites safely, so that I don't lose important data when creating documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file already exists at the target path THEN the system SHALL create a timestamped backup before overwriting
2. WHEN the backup creation is successful THEN the system SHALL proceed with writing the new content
3. WHEN the backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL abort the operation and return an error
4. WHEN the file write operation completes THEN the system SHALL confirm both the new file and backup exist

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with existing workflows, I want the utility to provide consistent error handling, so that I can reliably handle failures in my application logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs during file operations THEN the system SHALL return a structured error response
2. WHEN the error response is generated THEN the system SHALL include both technical error details and user-friendly messages
3. WHEN permission errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance about the permission issue
4. WHEN disk space errors occur THEN the system SHALL indicate the storage limitation clearly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer building document workflows, I want the utility to integrate seamlessly with the existing shared-imports system, so that I can import and use it consistently across the monorepo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the utility is implemented THEN the system SHALL export it from the shared-imports utils module
2. WHEN the utility is imported THEN the system SHALL provide both named and default export options
3. WHEN the utility is used in workflows THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent API patterns with other utilities
4. WHEN the utility is documented THEN the system SHALL include JSDoc comments with parameter and return type information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working with UTF-8 content, I want the utility to handle text encoding properly, so that markdown files and other text documents are created with correct character encoding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is written to a file THEN the system SHALL use UTF-8 encoding by default
2. WHEN special characters are included in content THEN the system SHALL preserve them correctly in the output file
3. WHEN the file is created THEN the system SHALL ensure it can be read properly by other text processing tools
4. WHEN content validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify the content is a valid string before writing
