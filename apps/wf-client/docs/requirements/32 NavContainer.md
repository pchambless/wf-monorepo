> Issue #32 | Created by pchambless | 5/5/2025

## Description
This describes the components to be included in a Navigation container to be positioned below the PageHeader.

## Components
**ButtonGroup component.**:  This will have buttons that have the various page group pages.
- Ingredients
- Products
- Accounts
- Dashboard

**Select widget components**:  This will have a group of four Select components with the ability to set visibility depending on whether they are pertinent to the page.  We can name them 'sel1', 'sel2', 'sel3', 'sel4'.  The will reflect the necessary levels for drilling down to the pertient page data.  I'm thinking we can define the visibility of the select widgets and the associated listEvent to populate them in the **columnMap**.
