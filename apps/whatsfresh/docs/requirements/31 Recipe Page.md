**Description**
I wish I could capture a snapshot of mysmith page to illustrate the layout I am envisioning.

Navigate to the Product you want to define or refine the recipe for.
**Table:** On the left is a table displaying the Product's ingredients, ordered by "order." It includes a delete icon button, order, Ingredient, Qty Measure (a concatenation of ingrQty and the label of measList
**Form:** The form will populate with the values of the corresponding columns when an ingredient is selected. The User can then modify the ingredient details.  

**Behavior / Flow**
The User should be able to Add, Edit, or Delete an Ingredient.

An **Add Ingredient** button should be present above the Table. Upon clicking it, the Form should display empty fields.
A Delete Icon should appear as the first column in the Table.
 **Submit** should be included in the Form, toggling between 'Update' (Update) or 'Add Ingredient (Insert) based on the operation When clicked, either the Delete Icon or the Submit button should trigger the DML Modal, the request and the expected **DML SQL** that will be generated by the server.

**Acceptance Criteria**
[ ] Existing rcpeList is displayed in the Table.
