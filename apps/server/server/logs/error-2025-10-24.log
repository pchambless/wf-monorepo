Plan 45 Impact Strategy\n- Establish patterns for what goes directly to Plan 45 vs separate plans\n- Create plan_communications cross-references for related work\n- Document decision criteria in Plan 45 communications\n\n## Future (Priority: low)\n\n### 5. Studio Enhancements\n- Add bulk page generation from template\n- Improve placeholder editor UI\n- Create template versioning system\n- Add mockup preview integration', '', '', 'claude', NOW(), 'Paul')","sqlMessage":"Column 'created_by' specified twice","sqlState":"42000","stack":"Error: Column 'created_by' specified twice\n    at PromisePoolConnection.execute (/home/paul/wf-monorepo-new/node_modules/mysql2/promise.js:111:22)\n    at executeQuery (file:///home/paul/wf-monorepo-new/apps/server/server/utils/dbUtils.js:57:40)\n    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)\n    at async processDML (file:///home/paul/wf-monorepo-new/apps/server/server/utils/dml/dmlProcessor.js:110:20)\n    at async execDML (file:///home/paul/wf-monorepo-new/apps/server/server/controller/execDML.js:13:24)","timestamp":"2025-10-24 11:14:16"}
