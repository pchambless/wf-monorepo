## 🏗️ Project Context: WhatsFresh Monorepo

- **Apps**:
  - `wf-client`: Ingredient tracking, recipe workflows
  - `wf-admin`: User management, system configuration - exclude until actively developing
  - `wf-server`: Node.js API for both apps
## 📦 Packages

- `db-connect`  
  Connection information for the MySQL database used by all services.

- `shared-imports`  
  Monorepo-wide dependencies, including both React and non-React utilities.

  ### 🧩 Component Types

  - **React (.jsx)** components  
    Defined in `src/jsx.js` and imported via:
    ```js
    import { CrudLayout } from '@whatsfresh/shared-imports/jsx';
    ```

  - **Standard (.js)** utilities  
    Imported directly from root or scoped entry points:
    ```js
    import { createLogger } from '@whatsfresh/shared-imports';
    import { getSafeEventTypes } from '@whatsfresh/shared-imports/events';
    ```

  This modular structure enables clean separation between UI and logic layers across apps. React components stay isolated from utility logic, while sub-path imports allow fine-grained control.

- `devtools`  
  Core generation tools and documentation assets.  
  - Powers config regeneration, page previews, and architectural documentation.
- **sql/ Folder Summary**
  - `legacy`: Snapshot of production DB artifacts — the real, existing schema (but incomplete).
    - `tables`: Core relational data — ingredients, batches, recipes, users, etc.
    - `functions & procedures`: Business logic (e.g. account activation, unit conversion)
    - `views`: Read-only aggregations and joins used by legacy apps.  
        - Includes batch summaries, trace views, recipe maps, and event logs
- ❗️ Guidance: Treat as reference only unless explicitly modifying; may contain hardwired business logic.
- **⚙️ views/**  
  App-facing EventType-driven views segmented by runtime context.  These are the heart of the client-server architecture, the bridge between the database -> server -> clients and back.

  - **📁 client/**  
    UI-facing SQL lists and helpers for the `wf-client` React app  
    - Includes: `btchMapRcpeList.sql`, `prodBtchList.sql`, `userAcctList.sql`, etc.  
    - 🗂️ Organized around ingredients, batches, recipes, and user-linked data  
    - `.vscode/`: Contains local editor settings _(safe to ignore for Claude config)_

  - **📁 admin/**  
    Supports account and user management in `wf-admin`  
    - 🧠 Interpretation:  
      - Clean, declarative wrappers around core entities  
      - Exposes EventType-friendly shapes for dynamic UI generation

  - **🚀 domain/**  
    Forward-looking / AI-suggested views for FDA compliance and traceability  
    - Driven by architecture goals more than current production data  
    - Organized by concept folders: `ingredient/`, `product/`, `mapping/`, `compliance/`  
    - Patterned into layers:
      - `foundation/`: Raw entity aggregates  
      - `crud/`: List-style views for UI rendering  
      - `analytics/`: Placeholder for metrics and insights  
      - `compliance/`: Regulatory reports and traceability outputs

---

## ⚙️ Generation Workflow & Commands

- Config generation powered by SQL → UI config → App-specific code
- Use `EventType` for UI routing decisions
- Use devtools CLI:
  - `npm run generate-client` → Regenerate client configs
  - `npm run generate-admin` → Regenerate admin configs
  - `npm run generate-docs` → Refresh architectural documentation

---

## 🚦 Repo Safety & Permissions

- Do **not** modify:
  - Anything under `legacy/` unless prompted
  - This `CLAUDE.md` file unless approved
  - Generated configs unless regeneration is disabled
- Claude is granted permission to:
  - Edit configs
  - Read and write in `/domain/`, `shared-*`, `devtools`
  - Run safe bash commands inside the repo

## 🚀 MVP Development Philosophy

**No Backward Compatibility Concerns**: During MVP development, prioritize forward progress over backward compatibility. If changes break existing functionality, fix the breakage and move forward rather than maintaining legacy patterns. This accelerates development and prevents technical debt accumulation.

**Break-and-Fix Approach**: 
- Make necessary architectural improvements immediately
- Address any resulting issues as they arise
- Favor clean, modern implementations over compatibility layers
- Focus on the target architecture rather than incremental migration

---

## 📋 Development Plans

Active development plans and issue tracking are maintained in `/claude-plans/`, organized with date-prefixed filenames for chronological sorting. See `/claude-plans/README.md` for workflow overview and folder structure.

- **Naming Convention:**  
  `yyyy-mm-dd descriptive-plan-name.md`

- **Purpose:**  
  Track implementation proposals, config fixes, and architectural decisions.

- **Usage:**  
  Reference these files to understand current development priorities and context.

### 📁 claude-plans/ Workflow Rules

- **Folder Structure:**
  - `a-pending/`: Contains active or in-progress development plans.
  - `b-completed/`: Contains finalized or fully implemented plans with updated internal status.

- **Plan Creation Workflow:**
  - **User**: Creates simple plan file in `a-pending/` with basic structure:
    ```md
    # User Idea
    [Raw text description of issue, feature request, or hoped-for result]
    ```
  - **Claude**: When notified, builds out full plan structure underneath:
    - Investigation points
    - Implementation strategy
    - Expected outcomes
    - Technical details
  - **Benefit**: User captures ideas quickly without formatting overhead

- **Claude Behavior:**
  - When a plan is explicitly approved or tagged as complete, Claude is permitted to:
    - Move the file from `a-pending/` to `b-completed/`
    - Update its internal plan status (e.g. summarize what was fixed or implemented)
    - Suggest optional follow-up steps or enhancements
    - Reference the finalized plan in future proposals for continuity

- **Filename Guidance:**
  - Claude may rely on filename cues such as:
    - `2025-07-08 client-navigation-fix.md`
    - `2025-07-07 sql-refactor-plan.md`

- **Manual Override:**
  - For audit control, add a metadata tag to mark a plan as finalized:
    ```md
    <!-- status:FIX_COMPLETE -->
    ```

## 🧭 Session Priming Prompt (Recommended)

> You are working inside the WhatsFresh monorepo. Stay concise but friendly.  Use diffs or direct edits. Do not touch legacy views unless explicitly told. All config flows are driven by SQL views and EventType logic.  Try to limit token usage to 1500 or less unless directed to proceed.  

> the user is always concerned about cleaning up artifacts (unused or obsolete files).  Whenever

## 🔧 DevTools Generator Commands

### Unified Entry Points
- `node src/automation/runCore.js` - Run all core operational generators
- `node src/automation/runTriggered.js [viewName]` - Run triggered generators for specific view
- `node src/automation/detectChanges.js` - Detect changed SQL views and suggest commands

### Individual Generator Commands  
- `node src/automation/triggered/genDirectives.js [viewName]` - Generate directive files from SQL views
- `node src/automation/core/genPageMaps.js` - Generate pageMap configurations 
- `node src/automation/static/genPageIndex.js client --all` - Generate React component wrappers
- `node src/documentation/generators/genEventTypes.js` - Generate mermaid charts (.mmd files)

### Generator File Locations
- **Core (Always Run)**: `packages/devtools/src/automation/core/`
- **Triggered (When Views Change)**: `packages/devtools/src/automation/triggered/`
- **Static (Rare Changes)**: `packages/devtools/src/automation/static/`
- **Documentation**: `packages/devtools/src/documentation/generators/`
- **Data Storage**: `packages/devtools/src/automation/data/`
- **Configuration Sources**: 
  - SQL Views: `sql/views/client/`
  - Events Config: `packages/devtools/src/configuration/events.json`
  - Directive Output: `packages/devtools/src/automation/data/directives/`

### 🔍 Common Debugging Patterns

#### Unified Naming Convention
**Key Rule**: `viewName` = `pageName` = `eventType` = `listEvent`
- Example: `measList` is the SQL view name, page name, event type, and list event
- Server processes use the same `eventType` name
- This pattern eliminates naming confusion across the stack

#### Quick File Locations (using [viewName] variable)
- **SQL View**: `sql/views/client/[viewName].sql`
- **Directive**: `packages/devtools/src/automation/page/directives/[viewName].json` 
- **Generated PageMap**: `apps/wf-client/src/pages/[viewName]/pageMap.js`
- **React Component**: `apps/wf-client/src/pages/[viewName]/index.jsx`

#### Common Issues → Solutions
- **MUI DataGrid "id" error** → Check pageMap `primaryKey` configuration in events.json
- **Fields hidden incorrectly** → Check directive generation preservation logic in genDirectives.js
- **Select widgets not working** → Check FIELD_PATTERNS in genDirectives.js
- **Widget warnings during generation** → Missing widget definitions in registry

## 🎯 Session Management & Planning

### Auto-Plan Triggers
Claude should proactively suggest creating a plan when:
- User mentions investigating/researching multiple files or systems
- Discussion involves 3+ interconnected changes or fixes
- User says "I need to understand how X works" about complex features
- Session reaches 10+ tool calls without a clear plan
- User mentions implementation but hasn't defined specific steps

### Token Conservation Strategy
- Keep sessions focused on single plans or investigations
- Suggest new sessions when shifting to different problem domains
- Reference completed plans from b-completed/ instead of re-explaining context
- Use concise plan updates rather than lengthy explanations

### Plan Completion Workflow (ADHD-Friendly Guardrails)

**End-of-Session Checklist:**
1. **Review Plan Status** - "Is this plan actually complete?"
2. **Move Completed Plans** - `a-pending/` → `b-completed/`
3. **Update Index** - Add entry to `b-completed/index.md`
4. **Generate Commit Message** - Claude provides ready-to-use commit message
5. **Commit Reminder** - "Ready to commit this plan completion?"

**Plan Completion Triggers:**
- User says "we're done with this" or "this is complete"
- All major tasks in plan are implemented and working
- User starts discussing next phase or different topic
- Session is ending with completed work

**Systematic Reminders:**
- **Before session ends**: "Any plans to move to completed?"
- **After implementation**: "Should we update the architectural evolution index?"
- **Before major commits**: "This seems like a good plan completion commit point"

**Commit Message Generation:**
When a plan is completed, Claude should generate a commit message following this template:
```
Complete: [Plan Name] - [Brief Description]

Key Changes:
- [Specific technical change 1]
- [Specific technical change 2]
- [Specific technical change 3]

Architecture Impact:
- [How this affects overall system]
- [What this enables for future development]

Plan Status: Moved to b-completed/, updated architectural evolution index.
```

**Benefits for ADHD-Friendly Development:**
- **Clear completion signals** - No ambiguity about what's done
- **Automatic documentation** - Progress tracking without extra effort
- **Structured transitions** - Clean handoff between plans
- **Commit discipline** - Regular progress commits with clear scope

### 🔍 Investigation Shortcuts & Quick Reference

**Claude Behavior**: When conducting multi-file investigations, suggest adding shortcuts to CLAUDE.md for future efficiency.

### 🔍 Investigation-First Behavior

Claude should treat plans as investigation-only by default unless explicitly instructed to proceed with a fix.

- **Default Behavior for Plans in `a-pending/`**:
  - Read and interpret user input
  - Identify relevant files, configs, and flows
  - Summarize findings, dependencies, and potential problem sources **within the active plan `.md` file** to preserve investigation results and context for future reference.
  - Do not generate code or suggest implementation unless prompted

- **To Proceed with Fix**:
  - User must clearly instruct Claude to implement solution, generate config, or apply edits

- **Tag-based Reinforcement (optional)**:
  - Plans may include the directive:
    ```md
    <!-- planPhase: Investigation only -->
    ```
    Claude will recognize this tag and suppress fix generation automatically

- **Purpose**:
  - Preserve tokens
  - Improve diagnostic clarity
  - Maintain user-led control over implementation timing

#### Suggest CLAUDE.md Updates When:
- You discover useful file/pattern relationships during searches
- You find repeated investigation paths that could be shortcuts
- You identify key files that are central to common tasks
- You uncover config dependencies that aren't obvious

#### Quick Reference Patterns (expand as discovered):
- **Config Chain**: `events.json` → `genDirectives.js` → `pageMap.js` → `index.jsx`
- **Error Debugging**: Check `primaryKey` in events.json first for MUI DataGrid issues
- **Widget Issues**: Start with `FIELD_PATTERNS` in `genDirectives.js`
- **SQL Changes**: Always regenerate with `npm run generate-client` after view edits
- **Navigation Issues**: Check `pageMap.js` routing config before component code

#### Future Shortcuts (Claude: add here during sessions):
- **TurboRepo Hot-Reload Issue**: shared-imports changes require manual dev server restart due to file: dependency limitations
- **Session Persistence Architecture**: contextStore (shared-imports/src/stores/contextStore.js) is the single source of truth for ALL session data - userID, acctID, and contextual parameters like prodTypeID, ingrTypeID, etc.
- **Automatic Parameter Resolution**: execEvent('eventName') auto-resolves all required parameters from contextStore. No manual parameter passing needed.
- **MobX Integration**: React components must be wrapped with observer() to react to contextStore changes. App.jsx structure: outer App (provides Router) → inner AppContent (has observer() wrapper)
- **Hierarchical Parameter Flow**: When user selects in widgets, contextStore.setEvent(eventType, value) stores the primaryKey for that eventType, enabling automatic parameter resolution for child events
- **Login/Logout Flow**: LoginPresenter stores all user attributes in contextStore → navService.logout() calls contextStore.logout() → clears auth params and navigates to /login
